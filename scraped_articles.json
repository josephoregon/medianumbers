          "title": "George Floyd's family describes heart wrenching experience in the courtroom during Derek Chauvin's trial, attorney says",
          "text": "(CNN) An attorney representing the family of George Floyd told CNN on Sunday being in the courtroom for the trial of the former police officer accused of killing Floyd has been \"heart-wrenching.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated trial of Derek Chauvin began Monday with video showing Floyd's final moments . Chauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.\n\nOnly one member from the Floyd and Chauvin families will be allowed to attend the trial in Minneapolis because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, a judge ruled in the case\n\nBen Crump, who represents Floyd's family, told CNN's Jim Acosta that as a Black man -- who also has been a civil rights attorney the entirety of his professional life -- he believes Chauvin will be convicted.\n\n\"My heart has been broken before, dealing with the American legal system,\" Crump said.\n\nCrump said he was shocked when defense attorneys started blaming the crowd outside of Cup Foods and that \"the only thing that killed George Floyd was an overdose of excessive force.\" Defense attorney Eric Nelson argued the bystanders at the scene of Floyd's death had morphed into a threatening crowd. This, in turn, distracted officers, Nelson said.\n\nMinneapolis 911 dispatcher Jena Scurry was the first witness in the closely watched trial.\n\nOne thing Crump did find compelling, he said, was the testimony from Jena Scurry , a Minneapolis 911 dispatcher who directed officers to the Cup Foods store, the scene of Floyd's death. Scurry called a police sergeant to voice her concerns about the arrest the day Floyd died, saying \"I don't know if they had to use force or not.\"\n\n\"My instincts were telling me that something's wrong. Something was not right. I don't know what, but something wasn't right,\" Scurry said she thought as she watched the video. \"It was an extended period of time.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Police lieutenant: Kneeling on Floyd was 'totally unnecessary' Replay More Videos ...

Richard Zimmerman , the Minneapolis Police Department's top homicide detective, who said Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck after handcuffing him was \"totally unnecessary.\"\n\n\"It says something when you have the highest-ranking police officials in Minneapolis Police Department also saying this is a bridge too far,\" Crump said. \"You knew you weren't supposed to keep a human being facedown like that where they could not breathe. And yet, you did it and you did it even after he had become unconscious.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED George Floyd's girlfriend talks about his life as a father and a son Replay More Videos ...

Fentanyl and methamphetamine use were among \"significant conditions\" found in Floyd's autopsy . His girlfriend, Courteney Ross, 45, said in her testimony that she and Floyd were addicted to opioids\n\n\"It's going to antagonize them over and over when (defense attorneys) try to tell them that his cause of death was not what they saw in this video, but some trace amounts of drugs that was found in his system,\" Crump said. The family expects it, he added, and they are prepared for the defense's strategy.\n\nChauvin's trial is scheduled to continue Monday."

          "title": "A week of compelling and potentially devastating testimony at Derek Chauvin's murder trial",
          "text": "(CNN) Pain, trauma and regret spilled out from a Minneapolis courtroom during a first week of critical testimony in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who knelt on the neck of George Floyd.\n\nThe week concluded with potentially devastating testimony from the police department's most senior officer, who called Chauvin's actions on the day of Floyd's death \"totally unnecessary.\"\n\nJurors heard for the first time that Chauvin actually knelt on Floyd for 9 minutes and 29 seconds -- not the 8 minutes 46 seconds that had became a symbol and rallying cry of a worldwide protest movement against police brutality.\n\nProsecutor Jerry Blackwell broke it down: 4 minutes and 45 seconds as Floyd cried out for help, 53 seconds as he flailed due to seizures, and 3 minutes and 51 seconds as Floyd was non-responsive.\n\nBlackwell, in opening statements, said 9-2-9 were the \"three most important numbers in this case.\" That was the time it took for Chauvin to squeeze \"the very life\" out of Floyd. The revised time emerged from a review of officers' body cameras months after May 25, 2020, police encounter.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking to know the torture lasted even longer,\" Chris Stewart, an attorney for Floyd's family, told CNN. \"This isn't the standard situation where an officer has to make a split second decision.\"\n\nThe time difference, which has little impact on the case, was an early highlight of the closely watched criminal trial. Here are others:\n\nEchoes of guilt from the stand\n\nChauvin, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The ex-cop, in a suit and tie, sat at the defense table most of the week, scribbling notes on a legal pad.\n\nIn opening statements, defense attorney Eric Nelson argued that video evidence failed to fully capture the complexity of the moment. Chauvin followed his police training, the lawyer told the jury.\n\nNelson argued that Floyd's death was the result of drug use and preexisting health issues. A crowd of what the attorney called hostile bystanders had distracted the officer.\n\nJUST WATCHED Witness wipes away tears listening back to his call to 911 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Witness wipes away tears listening back to his call to 911 03:32\n\nMixed martial arts fighter Donald Wynn Williams II was one of the most vocal bystanders that day. He pleaded for Chauvin to get off Floyd. He called the ex-cop a \"bum\" and a \"tough guy.\"\n\n\"I just was really trying to keep my professionalism and make sure I speak out for Floyd's life because I felt like he was in very much danger,\" Williams testified.\n\nUnder cross examination, Williams acknowledged calling Chauvin and another officer names. He yelled at them even after Floyd had been taken away. But, he said, he was not an angry onlooker.\n\n\"You can't paint me out to be angry,\" he said.\n\nWilliams was so disturbed by what he saw he called 911, he said.\n\n\"I called the police on the police,\" he said. \"I believed I witnessed a murder.\"\n\nWitnesses had little in common but trauma united them\n\nThe prosecution witnesses had little in common. A White off-duty firefighter. Some high school students. A 61-year-old man who broke down in tears. A 9-year-old girl. The Black MMA fighter.\n\nBut the trauma of watching an unarmed Black man die under a White cop's knee had brought them together. They spoke of their feelings of helplessness and guilt as Floyd gasped for air and pleaded for his life.\n\n\"These words are going to be churning around in jurors' minds and the question that's going to come out of this is, looking towards Derek Chauvin, the defendant in this case, 'Why didn't you move?'\" CNN senior legal analyst Laura Coates said of the testimony. \"Why didn't this move you the way it obviously moved so many other people?\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Witness testimonies describe details in Floyd death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Witness testimonies describe details in Floyd death 03:20\n\nThe teenager who took the widely known bystander video testified that in Floyd she saw her own Black father, brothers, cousins and friends.\n\n\"I look at that and I look at how that could have been one of them,\" Darnella Frazier said through tears.\n\n\"It's been nights I've stayed up apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life. But it's not what I should have done, it's what he should have done,\" she added, referring to Chauvin.\n\nFrazier was walking with the 9-year-old girl to the Cup Foods convenience store at the time of the arrest.\n\n\"I was sad and kind of mad,\" the girl testified. \"Because it felt like he was stopping his breathing, and it was kind of like hurting him.\"\n\nMinneapolis firefighter and certified EMT Genevieve Hansen was out for a walk on her day off. She testified that she saw Chauvin kneeling over Floyd's neck. She wanted to render aid and repeatedly asked police to check Floyd for a pulse. They refused.\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear what firefighter says cops told her when she tried to help George Floyd Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hear what firefighter says cops told her when she tried to help George Floyd 06:06\n\n\"I tried calm reasoning, I tried to be assertive, I pled and was desperate,\" said Hansen, who wept on the stand at one point. \"I was desperate to give help.\"\n\nUnder cross, Nelson tried to get Williams and Hansen to agree with his assertion that they and others were angry and threatening.\n\n\"I don't know if you've ever seen someone die in front of you, but it's very upsetting,\" Hansen told the defense lawyer at one point.\n\nAfter dismissing the jury, Judge Peter Cahill admonished Hansen.\n\nCNN legal analyst and defense attorney Mark O'Mara warned against attacks on sympathetic prosecution witnesses.\n\n\"The defense team has to be extraordinarily careful,\" he told CNN. \"If you're losing those 12 people because of your attack ... on one of the witnesses, you may never get that credibility back. This idea of throwing attacks, small as they may be, against whatever witness comes up can really backfire.\"\n\nChristopher Martin, the 19-year-old cashier who suspected Floyd had handed him a counterfeit $20 bill before the police were called, echoed the regret of other witnesses.\n\n\"If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided,\" said Martin, who was a cashier at Cup Foods, where the initial call to police was made that day.\n\nJury hears Chauvin's perspective\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Oh my God': Trial goes to break after witness breaks down on stand Replay More Videos ...

It looks like he's probably on something.\"\n\nThe short body cam clip provided the first public glimpse into the former officer's perspective.\n\n\"If you really think about it, what he was really just explaining away was, 'I would do anything that I needed to do. He's a big guy. He might have been on drugs,' and basically explaining away, in a very non-emotional way, the fact that this had happened to Floyd,\" O'Mara said of Chauvin's statement to the bystander.\n\nMcMillian testified as the prosecution played graphic excerpts of Floyd's final moments. Floyd gasped that he was claustrophobic. He repeatedly said he couldn't breathe. He called for his mother.\n\nMcMillian broke down.\n\n\"I feel helpless,\" he said. \"I don't have a mama either. I understand him.\"\n\nChauvin told supervisor Floyd 'was going crazy'\n\nJUST WATCHED Retired police sergeant describes phone call with Chauvin Replay More Videos ...

David Pleoger in a call captured on body camera footage.\n\n\"We just had to hold a guy down. He was going crazy. He wouldn't ... he wouldn't go in the back of the squad -- \"\n\nChauvin said Floyd became combative after officers tried to put Floyd in the car. After a struggle, Chauvin said, Floyd had a medical emergency, according to Pleoger. Chauvin did not mention he held his knee on Floyd's neck and back.\n\nAt the scene later, Pleoger asked officers to speak to witnesses. \"We can try but they're all pretty hostile,\" Chauvin responded.\n\nAt Hennepin County Medical Center later that night, Chauvin for the first time told his supervisor that he had knelt on Floyd's neck, Pleoger testified.\n\nPleoger told the jury that Chauvin's use of force should have ended earlier.\n\n\"When Mr. Floyd was no longer offering up any resistance to the officers, they could have ended the restraint,\" he said.\n\n\"It would be reasonable to put a knee on someone's neck until they were not resisting anymore, but it should stop when they are no longer combative.\"\n\nThe prosecution said Chauvin pressed down on Floyd's neck and back for nearly 4 minutes during which Floyd was non-responsive.\n\nSpeaking of Floyd, paramedic Derek Smith testified, \"I thought he was dead.\"\n\nA pair of Hennepin County paramedics who treated Floyd said he was unresponsive, not breathing and had no pulse when they arrived on the scene.\n\nParamedic Derek Smith checked Floyd's pulse and pupils, with Chauvin still kneeling on him. He believed Floyd's heart had stopped. One paramedic had to motion for Chauvin to lift his knee to lift Floyd onto a stretcher.\n\n\"In layman terms,\" Smith said, \"I thought he was dead.\"\n\nAt one point in the courtroom, Philonise Floyd turned his eyes away from the screen showing video of his brother on a stretcher. Philonise Floyd lowered his head, shaking it. He rubbed his bald head with his hand.\n\nJUST WATCHED George Floyd's brother describes having to relive his death in courtroom Replay More Videos ...

They both were addicted to opioids, which they were initially prescribed to treat chronic pain.\n\nFloyd was a mama's boy who was a \"shell of himself\" after his mother's death in 2018, she said.\n\nIn March 2020, she found Floyd doubled over in pain and took him to the emergency room.

Richard Zimmerman, head of the homicide division for more than 12 years. He joined the department in 1985, making him the most senior officer on the force.\n\nZimmerman said Chauvin's actions after Floyd was handcuffed and in a prone position were \"uncalled for\" and \"totally unnecessary.\"\n\nThe former's officers handling of the encounter violated department use of force policy, according to Zimmerman.\n\nAsked by prosecutor Matthew Frank if he was ever trained to kneel on a person, Zimmerman said no.\n\n\"Because if your knee is on someone's neck -- that could kill them,\" the lieutenant said.\n\nChauvin at that point raised his head at the defense table and shot a look at Zimmerman.\n\nMinneapolis Police Lt. Richard Zimmerman said Chauvin's actions after Floyd was handcuffed and in a prone position were \"uncalled for\" and \"totally unnecessary.\"\n\nUnder cross-examination, Zimmerman agreed that an unconscious person can become combative when revived, kicking and thrashing about.\n\nNelson sought to show that policing has changed significantly since Zimmerman got his training. He drew attention to Zimmerman's limited use of force experience as an investigator in comparison to a patrol officer.\n\nCoates said Zimmerman provided the \"most compelling law enforcement testimony\" in the trial so far. She called it \"damning.\"\n\n\"It blows out of the water any notion that the officer was trained to sustain this level of force on somebody once they were no longer posing any conceivable threat,\" she said."

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\n(CNN) The word \"trauma\" made its way into the English language from the ancient Greek verb that means to \"penetrate.\" The first known use of it came in 1693 when it was described as \"a wound from an external cause.\" But today our notion of trauma goes beyond the physical to include the extreme mental anguish that can penetrate lives.\n\nIn 2020, we had trauma every which way: a deadly pandemic, an economic plunge, a reckoning over race and a fraught election made for a time that will shape history for decades to come. That we are still coming to terms with all of it was clearer than ever this week.\n\nIn a Minneapolis courtroom, witnesses relived the pain of George Floyd's public death, as prosecutors revealed that Derek Chauvin, then a police officer and now on trial for the events of last May, knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, even longer than previously thought.\n\n\"What happened to him resembled a public execution, one that echoes for many the anti-Black lynchings that marked the Jim Crow era, \" wrote. A 9-year-old girl was one of the onlookers who testified. \"That an innocent child, teenagers and well-meaning bystanders had to bear witness to his death -- including a firefighter with training that might have saved Floyd's life -- is truly extraordinary.\"\n\nFor all the shock that the testimony produced, Joseph and others noted that Black Americans have become accustomed to such stark injustice.\n\nNia-Malika Henderson recalled her mother's tears in 1992 when violence broke out in Los Angeles after police officers were acquitted of the beating of Rodney King, which had been captured on video. \"'Black people are in so much pain,' she cried, covering her face with her hands and burying her head in her knees.\"\n\nHenderson isn't watching the murder trial of Derek Chauvin. She confessed that despite being a journalist, \"I have never seen the George Floyd video.\" On the trial, she wrote, \"I keep my television muted if it is onscreen. Or I change the channel to avoid seeing anything at all. More specifically, I, like so many others who have seen too much, am avoiding yet another display of Black pain, Black trauma and Black death.\"\n\nHer mother is watching the trial and texted her children, \"We owe George Floyd.\" And Henderson agrees. \"Floyd is owed. But he is not owed by Black people, whose suffering is too often on a constant loop, so much as he is by a nation that so regularly has enabled that suffering to continue.\n\nElie Honig said the defense will \"argue that Chauvin did not cause Floyd's death\" and \"may claim that Chauvin's actions were necessary to physically restrain Floyd and take him into custody.\" The prosecution's case is straightforward, Calling it \"one of the most important trials this country has ever seen,\" legal analystsaid the defense will \"argue that Chauvin did not cause Floyd's death\" and \"may claim that Chauvin's actions were necessary to physically restrain Floyd and take him into custody.\" The prosecution's case is straightforward, \"but the outcome is anything but certain, and the stakes -- for the entire country -- are enormous,\" Honig noted.\n\nElliot Williams noted, many of the witnesses spoke to what they felt and saw without getting at the \"central legal dispute at the heart of the case -- the technical cause of Floyd's death.\" Some \"highlighted the widespread guilt that so many felt over their failure to confront the gross inequalities baked into our daily lives that led to Floyd's death. They wondered whether they were complicit in perpetuating racial injustice, and In a way, there are two trials going on -- a narrow one to determine whether Chauvin is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and a larger, symbolic one about justice in America. Asnoted, many of the witnesses spoke to what they felt and saw without getting at the \"central legal dispute at the heart of the case -- the technical cause of Floyd's death.\" Some \"highlighted the widespread guilt that so many felt over their failure to confront the gross inequalities baked into our daily lives that led to Floyd's death. They wondered whether they were complicit in perpetuating racial injustice, and whether they could have done anything more to combat it .\"\n\nCapitol police officer killed\n\nThe trauma of Jan. 6, when rioters stormed the Capitol aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election, also lingers painfully. On Friday, security at the Capitol drew headlines when a driver on Constitution Avenue rammed a barricade. Police officer William \"Billy\" Evans was killed and a second officer was injured. The driver, identified as Noah Green, was shot to death by police, who said he was holding a knife.\n\nThe January attack at the Capitol was deeply personal for Theresa J. Fanone. Her son is a 20-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nFanone was watching the insurrection on television when she got an \"emotional, tearful\" call from Michael Fanone's police partner informing her he had been injured. \"My first conversation with Michael, who sounded terrified, began with, 'Mom, the hate in those people's eyes, they wanted to kill me, they kept screaming, 'kill him, kill him, get his gun and kill him.' Michael, along with many other officers, had been holding the door to the West Tunnel of the Capitol (the door the President uses when he takes the oath of office) when he was pulled through the doorway by the mob, pushed down the stairs, kicked, beaten, maced, tased repeatedly on his neck, had his face shield ripped off and his badge and radio taken.\"\n\nMichael's injuries resulted in a heart attack, due to trauma, stress and repeated tasing to his neck, burns on his neck and chest, a concussion, a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.\"\n\nOn March 25, former President Donald Trump called into a Fox News show to say his supporters had posed \"zero threat\" that day in January and had been \"hugging and kissing\" police officers. \"My experience of that day, and every day since, has been significantly different,\" Theresa Fanone wrote.\n\nDean Obeidallah pointed out. \"In the past few days,\" he wrote, \"we've seen the Michigan GOP state chair invoke the specter of violence against those not loyal to Trump and conservative Trump media allies saying on Newsmax that they wished the military would step in and take over from President Joe Biden. Before the attack on the Capitol this type of language was wrong. Today it feels like The febrile political climate in the United States has not gone away, aspointed out. \"In the past few days,\" he wrote, \"we've seen the Michigan GOP state chair invoke the specter of violence against those not loyal to Trump and conservative Trump media allies saying on Newsmax that they wished the military would step in and take over from President Joe Biden. Before the attack on the Capitol this type of language was wrong. Today it feels like a dangerous continuation of the type of incitement that led to the Jan. 6 attack .\"\n\nAsian-American hate\n\nThe wave of anti-Asian American violence that grew after Trump repeatedly labeled Covid-19 the \"Chinese virus\" also hasn't gone away. In one incident, on Monday a 65-year-old woman of Filipino descent was punched and kicked on a New York City street by an attacker shouting anti-Asian slurs.\n\nYumi Hogan, the first lady of Maryland and the first Korean-American first lady in the US, wrote, \"My fellow Asian Americans weep over the rising number of attacks against our people. But in the face of this senseless violence, I see a new strength, determination and resilience in our eyes.\"\n\n\"We will not stay silent anymore,\" Hogan observed. \"But we will also not respond with vengeance. Instead, we will love each other more, we will support each other more, and we will stand together. We will make sure the overwhelming outpouring of support from leaders turns into real and lasting action that protects our children and grandchildren.\"\n\nFor more views on hate and discrimination:\n\nSE Cupp: Hate lives here\n\nA missed birthday\n\nA year ago, Fiana Garza Tulip was sending videos of her seven-month-old daughter to her mother, who was \"filled with such joy every time she received a clip of her only grandchild.\" Tulip's mother, Isabelle Hilton Papadimitriou, was a respiratory therapist, and last June had a confrontation with a hospital visitor who refused to wear a mask, citing Trump's failure to wear one. Covid-19 spread through her hospital department and a few weeks later, Papadimitriou died of the disease. She would have celebrated her 65th birthday this week.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nTulip noted that former White House Covid-19 coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said on a CNN documentary that hundreds of thousands may have died needlessly from the disease. \"When the history of the American pandemic is written,\" Tulip wrote, \"my daughter will ask how things got so bad. I will tell her that it was an age of failed leadership, a collapse of moral courage by those who should have spoken out, a distrust of science, and a time when people stopped caring for each other. I will make sure she knows that her grandmother, 'Abuelita Obie,' deserved so much better and she should still be alive today.\n\nDr. Megan Ranney. \"Birx's next error was allowing the regime's lies to go unchecked. It's true that she said many things right, from her first day to her last. And as a White House team member, she would have found it hard to publicly contradict her boss. And it's understandable that she thought she would do more good from inside the administration instead of as an outside observer. She said this herself in January. But still -- she could have drawn the lines of honesty and integrity much earlier.\" Birx had a sterling reputation as a leader of programs to fight HIV/AIDS before she became coronavirus coordinator for the Trump administration. \"Accepting a job working for Donald Trump was her first and worst mistake,\" wrote. \"Birx's next error was allowing the regime's lies to go unchecked.

Turns out he is based on the real-life Mario Segale, the landlord of the Seattle-area warehouse where thousands of Nintendo arcade cabinets were waiting to be refitted with a new game four decades ago.\n\nIn 1986, Nintendo launched a home game console in the US, the NES, with Super Mario Bros.

The two-story building, a maximum-security facility that cost $17 million to build in 2004, is modeled after a state prison in Bunker Hill, Ind. It has a modest detainee health clinic and a psychiatric ward with a padded cell, but none of the hospice or end-of-life care capacity once envisioned by Pentagon planners.\n\nThe maximum-security facility is designed to keep prisoners confined to their cells except when guards move an individual to showers, outdoor cages that serve as recreation yards or another cell where a single captive can sit in a recliner, one ankle shackled to a bolt on the floor, and watch television.\n\nAs of Sunday, the military said, all 40 so-called war on terror detainees \u2014 the 11 men who have been charged with war crimes, as well as others who are held as indefinite detainees \u2014 were housed in a compound ringed with razor wire and containing two prison buildings, called Camps 5 and 6."

The charges range widely and include assaulting police officers, illegally entering the Capitol building and conspiring to interfere in the election certification process. The leaders of the Oath Keepers militia and the far-right Proud Boys group are among the most prominent targets of the sprawling investigation.\n\nCritics of a domestic terrorism statute say it could expand the government\u2019s surveillance authorities too much and be used against minority communities.\n\nA letter signed by Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and eight other Democrats said the intelligence failure surrounding the Capitol breach reflected a reluctance by law enforcement to crack down on white nationalist groups, not a lack of government tools to monitor them.\n\nOne homeland security official involved in the department\u2019s review of how to handle domestic terrorism said the agency did not need new laws but should instead employ the tools that have long been used against foreign terrorism.\n\nOne strategy is to analyze federal travel data to trace the patterns of possible militia members and extremists, especially as American groups increasingly establish connections to Europe, the official said. Members of the groups can then be added to so-called no-fly lists, he said.\n\nThe department\u2019s review is focused not only on clear acts of terrorism but also on those who are pushed to commit attacks because of a combination of mental health issues, grievances and ideologies that provide a perceived justification for violence. Officials are also evaluating how to prevent attacks similar to the one at the Capitol on Friday, where a man crashed his vehicle into two officers at a barricade outside the building before getting out and charging them with a knife.\n\nThe suspect, who was shot and killed by the police after the attack, was identified by law enforcement officials as Noah Green, 25, of Covington, Va. Friends and family say he struggled with isolation and mental health issues. The police have not categorized the attack as \u201cterrorism related,\u201d and investigators continue to scour Mr. Green\u2019s social media posts that showed an intensifying interest in the Nation of Islam."

Off the field, he was laser-focused on Black economic empowerment, counseling teammates on financial management and plotting a career helping close the racial wealth gap.\n\nBut by late March, after a bruising pandemic year that friends and family said left him isolated and mentally unmoored, Mr. Green\u2019s life appeared increasingly to revolve around the Nation of Islam and its leader Louis Farrakhan, who has repeatedly promoted anti-Semitism. \u201cFollower of Farrakhan,\u201d Mr. Green labeled himself on Facebook, where he described leaving his job and grappling with \u201csome of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life.\u201d\n\nNone of it appeared to hint at what he would do next. On Friday afternoon, law enforcement officials said, Mr. Green, 25, drove a dark blue Nissan sedan from nearby Virginia to the United States Capitol and plowed into two police officers protecting the grounds, killing one and injuring another. He then got out of the car brandishing a knife and lunged at officers. Police shot and mortally wounded him.\n\nThe attack, which pierced through the calm of a spring afternoon on Capitol Hill, halted the return to normalcy that had slowly begun to take hold there following the deadly Jan. 6 riot. It sent the police force that protects the Capitol into a fresh round of mourning and further complicated a raging debate over how to secure the seat of Congress at a time of increasing threat."

Reeves said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union:\n\n\n\nWell, I think you pay for it in a number of different ways.\n\nOne way you pay for it is by seeing significant improved economic growth. We saw that throughout the Trump administration because the policies were pro-business, they were pro-growth, and revenues improved.\n\nNow, unfortunately, during those four years, like the four years before that, they did not in Washington get control of spending. They feel as if the debt doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re looking at a debt burden today of nearly $30 trillion for Americans.\n\nAnd what\u2019s ultimately going to happen \u2014 and it\u2019s already happening \u2014 as interest rates rise, the share of our annual budget that goes to pay for interest expense is going to rise from what is already an enormous level of 15 to 20 percent of all federal revenues goes to pay interest expense.\n\nGov. Reeves was lying about the reason why the national debt exploded under Trump. It wasn\u2019t spending that caused the debt to grow. It was the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that caused a hole in the national debt that it will take decades to repair.\n\nThe Trump tax cut alone caused the federal budget deficit to soar by 31%.\n\nThe Trump tax cut for the wealthy did not increase revenue. It blew a hole in the federal debt that it will take generations to fix. The Trump tax cut did not grow the economy or raise wages.\n\nRepublicans have subscribed so deeply to the fallacy that tax cuts for the wealthy generate revenue that they have deluded themselves into believing that they can pay for programs by taking revenue away from the treasury.\n\nRepublicans can no longer do basic math. Two minuses do not equal a plus.\n\nThe worst thing that Joe Biden could do would be to follow any economic policy of Donald Trump.\n\nFor more discussion about this story join our Rachel Maddow and MSNBC group.\n\nFollow and Like PoliticusUSA on Facebook"

We need to make sure that we have broadband. I know that traditionally the internet wasn\u2019t considered infrastructure because in the Eisenhower years, of course, it didn\u2019t exist, but infrastructure investment has to include looking to the future.

Chris Christie Sunday called out Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams for praising a New Jersey in-person early voting law that provides fewer days of pre-Election Day in-person voting than a Georgia measure President Biden has compared to Jim Crow laws.\n\nThe New Jersey bill was signed last week by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, while the Georgia bill became law with the signature of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on March 25.\n\n\"Stacey Abrams was in New Jersey, in my state, praising Phil Murphy this week for a voting law where New Jersey early voting is nine days \u2014 half of what Georgia\u2019s is,\" Christie said during an appearance on \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\"\n\n\"Yet she\u2019s on TV in New Jersey \u2014 I saw it myself \u2014 saying that this is one of the greatest voting expansion bills we\u2019ve ever seen,\" Christie said.\n\nThe New Jersey legislation allows nine days of in-person early voting at a limited number of polling places, beginning on the tenth day before an election and ending on the Sunday before Election Day.\n\nGEORGIA GOV. KEMP HITS MLB, BIDEN AFTER ELECTION LAW PROMPTS ALL-STAR MOVE: NOTHING MORE THAN 'POLITICAL PLAY'\n\nGeorgia's new voting law provides a minimum of 17 days of early in-person voting and a maximum of nineteen days, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nAbrams, who waged a failed campaign for governor against Kemp in 2018, did a virtual appearance with Murphy Tuesday, the day he signed the voting bill into law. She praised the state for \"leading the way on automatic voter registration.\"\n\nAbrams touted the benefits of in-person early voting.\n\n\"I am so excited to be looking up, looking at New Jersey, knowing that New Jersey is taking us in the right direction,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"To Governor Murphy, to the state legislature, to the secretary of state, and to all the allies who made this possible, you have my heartiest not only congratulations, but you have my gratitude because you are showing the way to a better democracy and a better future for us all.\"\n\n\"While it is difficult for some folks to comprehend, leaders in states who expand rights should be praised, and leaders in states who restrict rights should not be,\" said Seth Bringman, spokesman for Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group launched by Abrams in 2018.\n\n\"I missed the part of the New Jersey bill that criminalized handing a voter a bottle of water,\" he said. \"We are thrilled Republicans now believe access to democracy should not depend on the state in which Americans live, so we look forward to their support of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\""

The move was made last April to keep passengers farther apart, a policy that Delta\u2019s CEO had repeatedly cited as raising trust in the airline. The seats would be reopened as air travel recovers and more people become vaccinated against COVID-19, the airline said.\n\nDelta said the middle seats were opened just for Sunday and Monday, and its seat-blocking policy has not changed. Where needed, seats could be unblocked in order to get customers to their destinations on the same day.\n\n\u201cDelta teams have been working through various factors, including staffing, large numbers of employee vaccinations and pilots returning to active status,\u201d the airline said in the statement. Some employees were having adverse side effects from being vaccinated.\n\nOn Sunday, websites at three Delta hubs showed 33 canceled arriving or departing flights. There were 19 at Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, another 11 at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and three more at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport.\n\nDelta said Wednesday that nearly 65 percent of people who flew on Delta last year expect to have at least one dose of the new vaccines by May 1. That gave Delta the assurance to end seating limits, it said.\n\nThe airline industry was divided over the utility of blocking middle seats to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 on a flight. Airlines including Delta, Southwest, Alaska and JetBlue limited seating for months, while United Airlines never did and American did so only briefly.\n\nSocial-distancing is hard if not impossible on an airplane, even with middle seats empty\u2014a point that United CEO Scott Kirby made many times to explain his airline\u2019s resistance to seat-blocking.\n\nAir travel in the United States is recovering from pandemic lows. More than 1 million travelers have gone through U.S. airports for each of the last 20 days, although March traffic remains down nearly half from the same month in 2019.\n\nThe numbers are rising heading into the crucial summer vacation season. Last summer was a catastrophe for the airlines, contributing to Delta\u2019s full-year loss of more than $12 billion. The airlines are eager to boost revenue as quickly as possible, and that means selling more seats.\n\nBy Tom Krisher"

Officials had said that unit, which was never designed to be permanent, had structural issues and needed to be replaced, but the Pentagon dropped plans to seek money for the construction.\n\nAmong those held at Camp 7 were the five prisoners charged with war crimes for their alleged roles planning and providing logistical support for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said he intends to close Guantanamo, but that would require approval from Congress to move some prisoners to the United States for trial or imprisonment."

(Charlotte Cuthbertson/The Epoch Times)\n\nNew Staff Deploy to Border Processing Facilities as Crisis Worsens\n\nARTESIA, N.M.\u2014As illegal border crossings continue to escalate, a crop of newly trained processing coordinators are being sent to El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley in Texas to help get Border Patrol agents back out on the line.\n\nThe 39 Border Patrol processing coordinators spent eight weeks training in first aid, processing, transportation, basic firearms, detainee care, and other skills. The new role was developed under the Trump administration in response to large numbers of Border Patrol agents being pulled away from border security to deal with humanitarian issues.\n\nThe new coordinators are \u201ctrained specifically to be able to care for the detainee population\u2014identifying the sensitive populations, the at-risk populations, making sure that the medical care that is needed is open to them,\u201d said Jason Owens, chief patrol agent of the Border Patrol training academy in Artesia, New Mexico.\n\nThe coordinators won\u2019t be armed or have arrest authority, as it\u2019s not a law enforcement position, but some of the graduates, such as Marco Mena, have a desire to eventually train as an agent.\n\nMena, 27, is one of 19 graduates who will begin work inside the El Paso temporary processing facility on April 5. The other 20 will deploy to the Donna, Texas, facility.\n\nMena was working in IT for Best Buy when a friend told him about the job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked working with people,\u201d Mena told The Epoch Times on April 2. \u201cAnd that caregiver side of me, I want to go ahead and help. There\u2019s a lot of unaccompanied minors, and I\u2019d like to be able to lend a helping hand in making sure that they feel safe, that they have somewhere where they are sheltered, where they have meals, where they can rest.\u201d\n\nA record high of more than 19,000 unaccompanied minors crossed the border illegally during the month of March, according to reports of preliminary numbers from Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nBy law, unaccompanied children are meant to be processed through CBP facilities within 72 hours, before being transferred to Health and Human Services (HHS). However, the facilities are so overwhelmed that some children remain in CBP custody for a week or more.\n\nOn April 2, CBP was holding more than 5,380 unaccompanied minors, while HHS had more than 13,000 minors in custody.\n\nThe Biden administration has opened emergency HHS facilities in San Diego; Fort Bliss, Texas; and several other locations.\n\nKarina Garza, 31, heard about the processing job from her neighbor, who\u2019s a Border Patrol agent in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nGarza has a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology, majoring in child psychology, but she was working in retail management before being accepted into the processing position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I know is beneficial to our country. It\u2019s just something that I look forward to, to just help assist our country,\u201d Garza told The Epoch Times. \u201cFrom what we\u2019re seeing and what we\u2019re being told, we\u2019re very much needed at the moment because of the influx.\u201d\n\nShe said the instructors and other agents have told her how instrumental her role will be in alleviating the pressure at the facilities.\n\nOwens said agents are now going to be able to return to patrol duty quicker.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to hit the field at a time when we need you the most,\u201d Owens said during the class graduation on April 2. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to do a better job at border security. We are better able to serve the American people.\u201d\n\nOwens said five more classes are scheduled to be completed this fiscal year at a facility in Charleston, South Carolina. In total, Border Patrol hopes to train 1,200 processing coordinators within the next four years. The job is guaranteed for 13 months but can be extended for up to four years.\n\nThe federal training facility in Artesia trains about 1,750 Border Patrol agents per year."

Democrats have charged that the charged rhetoric of the former president led directly to the attack by some of his supporters.\n\n\"Would any reporter do a story about Osama Bin Laden or Timothy McVeigh without mentioning their role in deadly terrorist attacks? Of course not,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"Same rule MUST apply to Donald Trump for his role as the inciter of the Jan 6 terrorist attack. Anything less is normalizing terrorism,\" he added.\n\n\n\nTrump had released a short statement earlier on Easter Sunday where he excoriated liberals and continued claiming that the election had been stolen from him.\n\n\"Happy Easter to ALL, including the Radical Left CRAZIES who rigged our Presidential Election, and want to destroy our Country!\" he said in the written statement.\n\nPrior to that statement he advocated that conservatives boycott Major League Baseball and other corporations who cave to demands from liberal activists and the media.\n\nOthers voices on the left have lamented that the news media continues to circulate the former president's statements despite Trump being banned from most popular social media platforms. He himself has said that Twitter did him a favor by banning him since his statements are getting more coverage than the tweets from his suspended account.\n\nHere's more on big tech banning Trump:"

His remarks also came after the MLB announced it was moving its 2021 all-star game out of Georgia in response to the new law.\n\n\"For years the Radical Left Democrats have played dirty by boycotting products when anything from that company is done or stated in any way that offends them,\" the former president said in a statement. \"Now they are going big time with WOKE CANCEL CULTURE and our sacred elections. It is finally time for Republicans and Conservatives to fight back \u2014 we have more people than they do \u2014 by far!\"\n\nHe continued, \"Boycott Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ViacomCBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS, and Merck. Don't go back to their products until they relent. We can play the game better than them.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"Never submit, never give up! The Radical Left will destroy our Country if we let them. We will not become a Socialist Nation. Happy Easter!\"\n\nOn Saturday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) said that the state was a victim of \"cancel culture\" following the law and ensuing backlash from the MLB and other companies like Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola.\n\nIn a news conference, Kemp said, \"Yesterday, Major League Baseball caved to fear and lies from liberal activists. In the middle of a pandemic, Major League Baseball put the wishes of Stacey Abrams and Joe Biden ahead of the economic well-being of hard-working Georgians who were counting on the All-Star game for a paycheck.\"\n\nTrump on Saturday also called for people to boycott the MLB, and in a statement said, \"Baseball is already losing tremendous numbers of fans, and now they leave Atlanta with their All-Star Game because they are afraid of the Radical Left Democrats who do not want voter I.D., which is desperately needed, to have anything to do with our elections. Boycott baseball and all of the woke companies that are interfering with Free and Fair Elections. Are you listening Coke, Delta, and all!\"\n\n"

          "text": "Biden\u2019s border crisis is spreading nationwide, according to a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies. The new administration is pursuing an immigration policy dubbed \u201ccatch-and-bus\u201d with the aim of establishing undocumented immigrants in states in the interior of the United States.\n\nThe Biden \u201csmuggling routes\u201d have gone largely unreported by media outlets that are fixated on the disastrous border crisis, where children are being kept in unsanitary conditions within detention facilities that violate COVID protocols.\n\nAccording to an original investigation by CIS, a veritable \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of busesfrom Texas, Arizona and California are transporting \u201cthousands\u201d of undocumented immigrants into America\u2019s heartland.\n\n\u201cThe buses rolling in a steady daily succession out of Del Rio \u2014 one charter a day, seven days a week, and before that weeks of filling Greyhound buses \u2014 represent a microcosm of a much broader aspect of the unfolding mass-migration crisis at the southern border that has attracted limited media coverage and occurs largely outside public view,\u201d CIS stated. \u201cTens of thousands of immigrants caught illegally crossing the border and then released under the new leniency policy of President Joe Biden are now dispersing to four corners of the United States on buses, with some of the more moneyed ones taking passenger jets.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs best as the Center for Immigration Studies can determine from interviews and scattered media reporting, the buses are leaving regularly from Del Rio, the Texas Rio Grande Valley communities, and Laredo, but the busing also appears to be going on in Arizona, as well as in California,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\u201cWhere are the buses going?\u201d the CIS rhetorically asked. \u201cThey often drop their Haitian, Venezuelan, and Cuban passengers in Florida and New Jersey. Those from Nicaragua and other Central American nations have been delivered to Tennessee, Massachusetts, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and to large cities in Texas such as Dallas and Houston.\u201d\n\nThe estimates square with other Border Patrol estimates, The Blaze corroborates.\n\n\u201cTodd Bensman, senior national security fellow for the center, estimated that roughly 30,000 migrants who entered the country illegally have been bused directly into the country since the start of the year,\u201d The Blaze reported. \u201cThat figure matches Border Patrol estimates TheBlaze reported on earlier this week.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies describes the \u201ccatch-and-bus\u201d process for many illegal migrants.\n\n\u201cAccording to Ortiz, Burrow, Border Patrol agents, and several migrants, many turn themselves into Border Patrol voluntarily after their illegal crossings, knowing well the good things that will follow,\u201d the CIS reports. \u201cThey are taken to a Border Patrol processing facility on the outskirts of town, where their fingerprints and identifiers are registered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the first months of November, December, January, and February, no one was getting tested for Covid,\u201d it adds. \u201cBut after a public outcry, DHS contracted a private company to conduct Covid-19 tests inside the Del Rio area Border Patrol facility. Every immigrant is now tested, Burrow said.\u201d\n\n\u201cDHS then provides many immigrants with an administrative document titled \u2018Order of Release on Recognizance\u2019, which grants them the legal right to be present inside the United States, according to two such documents that immigrants on the buses agreed to share,\u201d the report continues. \u201cThese require the immigrants to self-report to a deportation officer in their destination cities by a specific date provided.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne Nicaraguan migrant showed CIS a DHS document titled \u2018Interim Notice Authorizing Parole\u2019, which grants him a renewable one-year term to live legally inside the country,\u201d the report went on, adding, \u201cMost will likely use their time to apply for asylum, a lengthy, back-logged process that allows for work authorization and Social Security cards during an adjudication process that can drag on for years.\u201d\n\nThe Biden \u201ccatch-and-bus\u201d policy is an escalation of the Democratic Party\u2019s open borders policy. Even if a state is not on the southern border, an illegal migrant can walk across it and get a free bus ride from the Biden administration to any place it chooses.\n\nAs seen on Becker News.

The CDC recently clarified that vaccinated people do not spread COVID-19, which conflicts with its insistence that people should wear masks and social distance even after being vaccinated.\n\nPresident Trump is currently blocked by most social media platforms from issuing a fuller statement to the American People on Easter Sunday. When he was allowed to deliver video messages on social media, he went into the meaning of the religious holidays of Passover and Easter, such as in 2018.\n\n\u201cDuring the sacred holiday of Passover, Jewish families around the world give thanks to God for liberating the Jewish people from bondage in Egypt and delivering them to the promised land of Israel,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cFor Christians, we remember the suffering and death of God\u2019s only son and his glorious resurrection on the third day. On Easter Sunday, we proclaim with joy, \u2018Christ is risen.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn America, we look to the light of God to guide our steps, we trust in the power of the Almighty for wisdom and strength, and we praise our heavenly Father for the blessings of freedom and the gift of eternal life.\u201d\n\nThat is quite the remarkable contrast with what Americans saw from President Biden today.\n\nAs seen on Becker News.

It is important to note that this take is exceptionally rare to hear on corporate television and diverges from the rabid left-wing political messaging that has now become ubiquitous in sports broadcasting.\n\nBREAKING: Charles Barkley says racial division is driven by politicians pic.twitter.com/otD5hxt4k9 \u2014 Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) April 4, 2021\n\n\u201cMan, I think most white people and black people are great people,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cI really believe that in my heart, but I think our system is set up where our politicians, whether they\u2019re Republicans or Democrats, are designed to make us not like each other so they can keep their grasp of money and power. They divide and conquer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI truly believe in my heart most white people and black people are awesome people, but we\u2019re so stupid for following our politicians, whether they\u2019re Republicans or Democrats, and their only job is, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make these people not like each other. We don\u2019t live in their neighborhoods, we all got money, let\u2019s make the whites and blacks not like each other, let\u2019s make rich people and poor people not like each other, let\u2019s scramble the middle class. I truly believe that in my heart.\u201d\n\nCharles Barkley has a history of having some of the most level-headed takes on race relations in America. He has even hosted a six-part series on race relations called \u201cRace in America.\u201d And while most of his sports broadcaster colleagues our unleashing ill-informed, partisan talking points that tow the party line, Barkley has been known to speak his own mind.\n\nIn September 2020, for example, Barkley riled up left-wing CNN for questioning the narrative on the Breonna Taylor shooting. Barkley hilariously dismantled the race hoaxer Jussie Smollett for staging an event with \u201ctwo black guys beating a black guy up,\u201d and added, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to break the law, don\u2019t write a check.\u201d He also angered local Baltimore residents by not feeding into the media narrative about the death of Freddie Gray.\n\n\u201cAmerica discriminates against poor people, whether you\u2019re white, black, Hispanic, whatever,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cPoor people are dealt a crappy hand.\u201d\n\nWe have gotten to the point in America where people need to hear common sense. It is not clear, however, exactly how Republicans feed instead racial division, except by being accused of \u2018racism\u2019 by Democrats for political gain. But Charles Barkley is spot on for the overall point. If Americans really think about the issue, they can figure out on their own who is stoking racial division in the country.\n\nAs seen on Becker News. Follow Kyle Becker and Becker News on Twitter."

It is now up to 43K dislikes with only 7.5K likes, suggesting that the deletion mechanism is inconsistently applied.\n\nThe National Pulse website catalogued other examples of Biden video dislikes. It also notes the huge disparity between Trump videos and Biden videos:\n\nIn contrast, President Trump\u2019s latest address \u2013 live-streamed on the Right Side Broadcasting Network account \u2013 has over 145,000 likes and just 4,500 dislikes.\n\nNumerous observers early on in Biden\u2019s administration noted there appeared to be a scrubbing of dislikes.\n\nThe technocrats overlords are going to censor and \"correct\" absolutely everything now. YouTube dislikes, comments, whatever. If they are willing to fake the vote they are willing to fake everything. And it will be justified with rationalizations just like ones used for AA. pic.twitter.com/A2Eo3GRk5A \u2014 ChadWolf Gardening Specialist (@ChadSpecialist) January 22, 2021\n\nYouTube erasing dislikes for Joe Biden\u2019s administration. pic.twitter.com/4zmd1MkxJx \u2014 Zach Vorhies (@Perpetualmaniac) January 21, 2021\n\nWait\u2026\u2026\u2026 is this really true? did Youtube get ride of the number of dislikes on Joe Biden's first video? and then later private the video to hide it? pic.twitter.com/vltq9FAufA \u2014 Luke Rudkowski (@Lukewearechange) January 21, 2021\n\nThere you have it: Youtube is removing millions of dislikes for Biden, who entered office with one of the lowest approval ratings on record.

          "text": "Old Proverb \u2013 Those With Nothing To Hide Don\u2019t Try To Hide Things\n\nGA SoS Brad Raffensperger\n\nImage by Nydia Tisdale\n\nPlease Follow us on Gab, Parler, Minds, Telegram, Rumble\n\nGA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger seems like he has a secret. The man in charge of ensuring fair elections in the Peach State really doesn\u2019t want anyone looking at the actual ballots from the Nov 3rd U.S. general election.\n\nThere is an old proverb \u2014 those with nothing to hide don\u2019t try to hide things.\n\nFair election activists from VoterGA.org have worked hard and succeeded in gaining access to ballots from Fulton County, GA for a forensic audit. A judge will rule on the procedures later this month.\n\nThis is scaring the pants off those who enabled the massive election fraud in November\u2019s general election and the GA Senate run-off in January.\n\nWe have seen the same obstruction of justice in Maricopa County, AZ and other swing-states which were hit by fraud.\n\nThe GA Secretary of State\u2019s office filed an amicus brief yesterday in support of corrupt Fulton County election officials.\n\nYou can read the brief in the file below.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHere are some amazing highlights from the legal filing:\n\nRaffensperger suggests he is simply \u2018protecting the public\u2019s interest\u2019 in allowing on the ballot images to be used, and not the actual paper records.\n\nThe Secretary respectfully requests that the Court permit Petitioners to inspect ballot images only, and deny Petitioners\u2019 request to inspect and scan ballots.\n\nPetitioners have submitted to the Court a proposed order granting their Motion to Unseal,\n\nwhich would grant Petitioners sweeping and unprecedented access to all ballots. (the horror)\n\nRaffensperger also told an \u2018alternative fact\u2019 in his brief, claiming VoterGA wants to move the ballots from their secure location for the audit. CDMedia spoke to VoterGA and this is simply not true.\n\nFirst, it is important to clarify the difference between \u201cballots\u201d and \u201cballot images.\u201d\n\n\u201cBallots\u201d include (1) paper ballots produced by ballot marking devices (\u201cBMDs\u201d) used in in-person advanced voting and election-day voting; 1 (2) absentee-by-mail paper ballots; and\n\n(3) UOCAVA paper ballots. Ballots are then scanned through optical voting scanners selected\n\nand furnished by the State of Georgia pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 21-2-300. Once scanned, an\n\nelectronic ballot image is created and stored on a memory card (\u201cballot images\u201d).\n\nSo in short, Raffensperger wants VoterGA to only have access to the \u2018images\u2019 that were created by equipment furnished by the GA Secretary of State\u2019s office and not the actual ballots that show the intended anonymous vote of GA citizens.\n\nThe arrogance is quite shocking; although, after Nov 3rd, we shouldn\u2019t be shocked at anything.\n\nRaffensperger declares that only he is allowed to see what actually happened.\n\nThe Elections Code is furthermore clear that it is only authorized elections officials who\n\nare legally permitted to verify and tabulate ballots in an election.\n\nAnd, he doesn\u2019t want any outside technology that can detect counterfeit ballots.\n\nMoreover, the scanning and tabulation of ballots is only permitted under Georgia law to\n\nbe conducted on the equipment selected and furnished by the State of Georgia.\n\nThere is simply no legal basis for unauthorized third parties such as Petitioners to electronically scan ballots using their own equipment in order to conduct their own independent tabulation of ballots.\n\nAllowing Petitioners to conduct their own scan on uncertified and unknown equipment is contrary to law and would set a new and dangerous precedent going forward.\n\nPerhaps Raffensperger should add to his brief that only Chinese equipment is allowed to scan American ballots.\n\nFinally, Raffensperger declares its simply too late for anyone to do anything about the massive election fraud which occurred on Nov 3rd.\n\nTo the extent that Petitioners are using this open records act enforcement action as a pretext for challenging the legality of ballots cast in the general election, it is too late for them to assert such a challenge now, and any request for relief would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n\nAfter reading the amicus brief in full filed by the GA Secretary of State\u2019s office, we believe any intellectually honest person would now want to scan the real ballots, and not just the \u2018ballot images\u2019 created by machines.",

          "text": "Image by Hesam404\n\nPlease Follow us on Gab, Parler, Minds, Telegram, Rumble\n\nIn today\u2019s Iranian society, rising prices, unemployment, a sharp decline in the value of the currency, government corruption, protests by retirees, teachers, workers, and farmers, and long queues to buy food can clearly be seen. Many experts say the economic and living conditions of Iranians cannot easily be measured and calculated by the usual classic criteria, and the danger of the collapse of the Iranian economy sparking an explosion of fury from the distressed people will be seen in the near future.\n\nAfshin Kolahy, a private sector activist, told the Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) on March 22, 2021, \u201cEven with the JCPOA agreement,\u201d an extraordinary event \u201cwill not happen in Iran, and by the end of 2021 Iran will experience 65% inflation and a dollar equivalency above 35,000 Tomans\u2026 In the last few years, we have had a lot of setbacks.\u201d\n\nThe supreme leader Khamenei is constantly running to the scene to control the situation. Speaking on March 21st, 2021 about the country\u2019s production in the past year, he said: \u201cTo be fair, there was progress in important sectors of production. In some cases, we could even call it a jump in production, in others, even though there is no jump, there is definitely progress in production.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAutomobile tires, aluminum, petrochemicals, steel, commodities like these, have had progress and growth\u201d.\n\nKhamenei, of course, refers to industries such as the production and distribution of drugs, production, and exploitation of metal and nonmetal mines, the oil, petrochemical, gasoline, diesel, and steel industries, and agro-industrial companies, etc., which are exclusively in the hands of the Supreme Leader Khamenei and the IRGC affiliated mafia whose profits have skyrocketed at the expense of the closure of hundreds of factories and bankruptcy of small workshops.\n\nMohsen Dehnavi a member of parliament told the Khane Mellat state-run newspaper on September 8, 2020, that \u201cmore than 45,000 industrial and production units are located in industrial parks, of which 21% have been completely shut down,\u201d meaning that about 9,450 production units in industrial parks have been closed.\n\nTasnim News Agency wrote on January 13, 2021, \u201cMore than 2,000 production units have been repossessed and closed by banks.\u201d\n\nOne of the consequences of the closure of this number of factories and workshops and the disappearance of many side jobs of these work units is the further impoverishment of the poor and the disappearance of the middle class as they join the deprived classes (Hamdeli State-run newspaper July 15, 2020). This same newspaper on July 18, 2020, quoting Javad Hosseinzadegan, head of the Statistics Center of Iran wrote: \u201cThe increase in population of people living in city outskirts, the budget deficit of households, the slipping of the middle class into the poor and even the evaporation of this class are among the thousand and one other harms that feed on poverty.\u201d.\n\nShargh newspaper, June 24, 2020 wrote, \u201cHouseholds, step by step, are going down from every level of income and we are clearly facing an increase in population of people in city outskirts living in dilapidated structures.\u201d\n\nIbtekar Newspaper on July 6, 2020, wrote \u201cThe collapse of the middle class will have many consequences for the regime. The set of logic governing economic conditions in Iran \u2026. has increased the class distance and removed the middle layer from the top to the bottom of society.\u201d\n\nThe result of such an economy is an increase in popular discontent, which led to protests in 200 cities in November 2019 and continues. During February and March 2021, protests peaked in Saravan, Balochestan, Gonbad Kavus, and Zahedan and led to the setting fire of security forces vehicles making them flee the scene. Government officials, however, resorted to crackdowns, intimidation, and censorship of the Internet, shooting protesters, and arresting and hanging popular young people, such as Navid Afkari, the Iranian wrestling hero, and Ruhollah Zam, an Iranian journalist.\n\nSome experts consider the pain of ordinary people to be a time bomb that the Iranian government ultimately has no power to neutralize. In such circumstances, the Iranian regime is significantly weak and incapable of protecting and securing its interests. Government newspapers now report the smuggling of weapons into Iranian cities on a daily basis..\n\nOn March 1, 2021, the Deputy Commander of Khuzestan Police announced the discovery of more than 4,800 illegal weapons in the province since the beginning of the year.\n\nOn February 22, 2021, the police commander of West Azerbaijan announced the discovery of weapons and ammunition and the arrest of two members of a gang carrying weapons and ammunition on the Urmia-Tabriz road.\n\nHowever, with Biden coming to the White House, Iran\u2019s currency rose against the dollar by 20%. Many Iranian officials had hoped that Biden\u2019s victory would mean a return to the 2015 JCPOA but despite Washington\u2019s soft policy toward Tehran, Iran enhanced its nuclear ambitions. When the US foreign minister said we have a long way to go before rejoining the JCPOA, the dollar climbed again against Iran\u2019s currency.\n\nGlobal condemnation of Iran increased in 2020 as a result of the regime\u2019s handling of the November 2019 uprising. At the United Nations, Canada proposed a resolution condemning the regime\u2019s human rights record that was successfully passed.\n\nIn a letter to Biden, 158 members of Congress condemned the Iranian government\u2019s crackdown on the November 2019 Iranian protests and other human rights abuses and called for a firm policy against the regime.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, 43 senators from both parties also wrote to Biden reminding him of the need to use all the tools of Washington\u2019s diplomatic and economic power to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and furthering its destabilizing activities in the region.\n\nAll these difficulties highlight the basic and inevitable reality for Iran in 2021, a fact that Iranians have highlighted on social media. It shows the prospect of a severe economic crisis, with dried-up trade and collapsed industry, effectively a country in international isolation.\n\nYou Won\u2019t Get Anywhere Else What You Get From CDMedia!

          "title": "Americans Oppose Many Voting Restrictions \u2014 But Not Voter ID Laws",
          "text": "Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nLast week, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping package of voting restrictions into law in Georgia. The new regulations \u2014 including a ban on giving food and water to voters in line and an ID requirement for absentee voting \u2014 drew harsh condemnation from Democrats, voting-rights advocates and corporations for making voting more arduous, particularly for Black voters who will be disproportionately affected. And alarmingly, the laws appear to be inspired by a baseless belief in rampant voter fraud in the 2020 election and designed to make it easier for Republicans to win elections in the future.\n\nThe new voting restrictions many states are considering\n\nBut how many Americans buy into the Republican argument that more \u201celection security\u201d is needed, and how many believe that these laws are undemocratic? On the surface, at least, they are closely divided on the issue of voting access. According to a YouGov/The Economist poll from March 20-23, Americans narrowly oppose \u201claws that would make it more difficult to vote,\u201d 44 percent to 39 percent. But of course, that\u2019s an extremely broad categorization that covers everything from laws cleaning up the voter rolls to those outright banning no-excuse absentee voting and slashing polling places. Reality is more nuanced: Americans are fine with some voting restrictions but balk at others.\n\nrelated: The States Where Efforts To Restrict Voting Are Escalating Read more. \u00bb\n\nFor instance, public opinion is strongly against perhaps the most controversial provision of Georgia\u2019s new law: the prohibition on giving food or water to people waiting in line to vote. In a different, March 29 poll, YouGov found that only 18 percent of Americans thought handing out food and water should be illegal, while 69 percent thought it should be allowed.\n\nLikewise, in the most recent YouGov/The Economist poll (conducted March 27-30), only 33 percent of Americans agreed with the part of Georgia\u2019s new law that makes ballot drop boxes only accessible during early-voting hours. By contrast, 44 percent thought drop boxes should be open at all times. Drop boxes were also popular within Georgia itself. Back in January, a University of Georgia/Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that Georgia registered voters opposed banning them 59 percent to 37 percent. While the new law didn\u2019t go that far, it did make them a lot less useful by mandating that they be located inside early-voting centers.\n\nOn the other hand, the public strongly supports one of the other major stipulations of Georgia\u2019s new law: the ID requirement for absentee voting. That latest YouGov/The Economist poll found that Americans support requiring a photo ID in order to vote absentee, 53 percent to 28 percent. And Georgians are even more supportive: 74 percent of registered voters in the UGA/AJC poll backed requiring voters to include a copy of their photo ID or other documentation in order to vote by mail. Only 22 percent were opposed.\n\nIndeed, voter ID laws \u2014 which Republicans have pushed for years \u2014 are quite popular in general. In another national poll out this week from Selzer & Co./Grinnell College, 56 percent of adults favored keeping laws that require people to show a photo ID before voting, while just 36 percent wanted to eliminate them. And this isn\u2019t an opinion Americans suddenly adopted amid 2020\u2019s specious claims of voter fraud. In fall 2018, the Pew Research Center found that 76 percent of Americans favored requiring everyone to show a government-issued photo ID in order to vote, versus only 23 percent who opposed it.\n\nOne voting restriction that Georgia did not end up enacting was requiring voters to have an excuse in order to vote absentee. Politically, it seems to have been a wise choice to kill that: According to the UGA/AJC poll, Georgians opposed the proposal 55 percent to 43 percent. Nationally, YouGov/The Economist found a nation divided over whether anyone should be able to vote by mail (44 percent) or only people who are unable to vote in person (42 percent), but that poll is an outlier. Selzer/Grinnell found that Americans favor keeping laws that allow mail voting 56 percent to 34 percent, and Pew last year found that 65 percent of the country believed that voters should not need a documented reason to be allowed to vote early or absentee. That wasn\u2019t just because of the pandemic, either: In Pew\u2019s 2018 poll, that number was 71 percent.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a reason why \u2026 (GOP has) tried to make it harder for people to vote\u2019: Silver\n\nThat said, Georgia\u2019s new law does prevent election officials from actively encouraging absentee voting by prohibiting mailing absentee-ballot applications to voters who don\u2019t request them \u2014 something the secretary of state did in last year\u2019s primary in order to encourage mail voting amid the pandemic. According to the UGA/AJC poll, Georgia seems to be split right down the middle on this prohibition: 49 percent are against it and 47 percent are for it. But the public is more firmly against more aggressive promotions of absentee voting, at least on the national level. For example, respondents to the YouGov/The Economist poll opposed mailing absentee ballots to all registered voters (which nine states and Washington, D.C., did in 2020), 59 percent to 24 percent. And per Pew, back in 2018, Americans opposed conducting all elections by mail, 65 percent to 34 percent.\n\nGeorgia is hardly the only state where legislators are considering changing voting laws \u2014 either to make them stricter or, in many cases, more accessible. But the complicated public opinion on voting issues just goes to show that not all voting reforms are viewed the same way \u2014 and neither party should assume the public is fully on their side.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nWashington\u2019s consternation over potentially abolishing the Senate filibuster doesn\u2019t appear to be shared by the American people. According to a YouGov/Yahoo News poll, 36 percent of adults support ending the filibuster, while only 27 percent oppose it. A whopping 37 percent are unsure. That may be because only 34 percent of adults say they know \u201ca lot\u201d about how the filibuster works; 40 percent say they\u2019ve heard of the filibuster but don\u2019t know how it works, while 26 percent say they know \u201cnothing\u201d about the filibuster.\n\nFor the first time in more than 80 years of Gallup polling, fewer than half of Americans say they are a member of a church, synagogue or mosque: 47 percent, down from 70 percent as recently as 1999. The drop is driven by generational change: While 66 percent of those born before 1946 are still members of a house of worship, only 36 percent of millennials (born 1981-1996) are. That\u2019s roughly the same as the share of millennials with no religious affiliation (31 percent).\n\nIt\u2019s not news that Americans are frustrated with government, but it\u2019s still sobering to see it quantified. According to the Pew Research Center, 53 percent of Americans are \u201cnot too\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d satisfied with the way democracy is working in the U.S. (only 45 percent of Americans are at least somewhat satisfied with it). In addition, 67 percent of Americans think the phrase \u201cmost politicians are corrupt\u201d describes their country well. Both numbers are higher in the U.S. than in the three other countries Pew surveyed: the United Kingdom, France and Germany.\n\nThursday was the first day of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, which will look pretty different from past seasons thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. To the approval of 62 percent of MLB fans (per a recent Ipsos poll), every team except the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros will open stadiums to less than half capacity to start the season. But MLB will not mandate proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test in order to attend a game, despite 67 percent of fans supporting such a requirement.\n\nThursday was also April Fool\u2019s Day, a day that this year saw Bud Light \u201cintroduce\u201d a pizza-flavored seltzer and the Chicago Bears \u201ctrade for\u201d a star quarterback. Probably only about half of Americans appreciated these gags, though: According to YouGov, only 45 percent of adults think April Fool\u2019s Day pranks are generally funny, while 47 percent are no fun and think they\u2019re mostly just annoying.\n\nBiden approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 54.0 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 39.6 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +14.4 points). At this time last week, 54.3 percent approved and 39.9 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +14.4 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 53.9 percent and a disapproval rating of 37.1 percent, for a net approval rating of +16.8 points.\n\nElections to watch in 2021| FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast\n\nWhat are pollster ratings? | Polling 101 from FiveThirtyEight"

          "title": "Why The Recent Violence Against Asian Americans May Solidify Their Support Of Democrats",
          "text": "Even before the coronavirus became a worldwide pandemic, some astute observers of racial and ethnic politics feared that the emerging outbreak in China would lead to (and were already contributing to) a rise in anti-Asian sentiment in America. After all, the United States has a long and ugly history of scapegoating racial and ethnic groups for diseases in ways that are used to justify xenophobia.\n\nSadly, it didn\u2019t take long for those fears to be realized. Racist harassment online, verbal attacks in public and physical assaults against Asian Americans all surged in the early days of the pandemic and have remained alarmingly high ever since. In fact, anti-Asian hate crimes in the U.S. increased by nearly 150 percent from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHow the Atlanta attacks may activate Asian Americans politically\n\nBut it took the murder of six Atlanta women of Asian descent in March for many to finally realize the seriousness of the problem. According to Google Trends data, Google searches like \u201cAsian Americans\u201d and \u201cviolence against Asian Americans\u201d skyrocketed after the shooting. Similarly, the share of respondents in last week\u2019s YouGov/Economist poll who said there is \u201ca great deal\u201d of discrimination against Asian people (33 percent) doubled since YouGov asked this question in March 2020 after reports of COVID-19-related backlash against Asian Americans had initially surfaced.\n\nRelated: The U.S. Has A Long-Standing History Of Vilifying Minority Groups During Times Of Crisis Read more. \u00bb\n\nOf course, as the targets of this hatred, Asian Americans have been much more aware of the growing problem. In a June 2020 Pew Research Center poll, 58 percent of Asian Americans said it was more common for people to express racist or racially insensitive views about people who are Asian than it was before the coronavirus outbreak, compared to just 39 percent of all adults. And about half of those surveyed in AAPI Data\u2019s 2020 Asian American Voter Survey also said they worried \u201cvery often\u201d or \u201csomewhat often\u201d about experiencing hate crimes, harassment and discrimination because of COVID-19.\n\nThe effect of this hatred has partisan ramifications, too. Asian Americans\u2019 escalating fears of discrimination and harassment during the pandemic will likely solidify their already strong support of Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s true for a couple of reasons. First, perceptions of discrimination and feelings of social exclusion are strongly linked with how Asian Americans vote. Take, for example, the relationship between Asian Americans who said they perceived discrimination and how they said they would vote in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOver three-quarters of Asian American and Pacific Islanders voters who thought there was \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of anti-Asian discrimination in the U.S. supported Joe Biden over Donald Trump in weekly Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape surveys conducted from April to September 2020. But only 37 percent of Asian Americans who didn\u2019t think there was any anti-Asian discrimination preferred Biden to Trump in the presidential election.\n\nPolitical scientists Alexander Kuo, Neil Malhotra and Cecilia Mo have argued that Asian Americans who experience discrimination are more likely to support Democrats because they associate social exclusion based on their ethnic background with the predominantly white Republican Party. Take, for example, what Kuo, Malhotra and Mo found in one experiment. Some participants were randomly subjected to a microaggression from a white lab assistant who questioned their citizenship before having them answer a survey that measured political attitudes. The Asian Americans subjected to the microaggression were 13 percentage points more likely than the control group to view the Democratic Party in a positive light.\n\nThis uptick came at the expense, too, of how respondents thought about the Republican Party. That is, the Asian Americans who were subjected to the microaggression were more likely to say that Republicans were close-minded and associate the party with exclusionary treatment. That is something that has been made much more explicit during the pandemic.\n\nrelated: Women Of Color Were Shut Out Of Congress For Decades. Now They\u2019re Transforming It. Read more. \u00bb\n\nDemocratic politicians, for instance, have consistently shown far greater concern than their Republican counterparts over the rise in hate directed against Asian Americans during the pandemic\u2014 differences that were clearly on display in the 2020 presidential campaign. Then-candidate Joe Biden forcefully condemned President Trump\u2019s repeated use of terms like \u201cChinese virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d to describe the coronavirus, warning that such language could endanger Asian Americans.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence to support those concerns, too. Two recent studies found that online animosity and offline hate incidents against Asian Americans heightened after Trump linked China and COVID-19 in his tweets; another study found that Trump\u2019s framing of the pandemic as China\u2019s fault increased anti-Asian sentiments and xenophobia in survey experiments; and there\u2019s evidence, too, that rank-and-file Republicans have become much more hostile toward China during the pandemic \u2014 views that experts warn pose a threat to all Asian Americans.\n\nIn total, the prejudice Asian Americans have experienced during the pandemic does seem to have further solidified their already strong support of the Democratic Party. Analyzing data from weekly Nationscape surveys conducted between July 2019 and May 2020, political scientists Nathan Chan, Jae Yeon Kim and Vivien Leung show that Asian Americans moved more toward the Democratic Party than other racial and ethnic groups after Trump first made ethnically inflammatory remarks about the coronavirus. Chan and his colleagues concluded from their findings that exclusionary rhetoric from partisan elites \u201cfurther cement[s] Asian Americans as Democrats.\u201d\n\nThis certainly doesn\u2019t mean that social exclusion and experiences with discrimination are the only reasons why Asian Americans have overwhelmingly supported Democrats. Nor is it possible to precisely predict how the rise in anti-Asian hate during the pandemic will affect Asian American partisanship in the long run. But, at the very least, Republican rhetoric about the pandemic and the rise in anti-Asian hate over the past year seems to have solidified the longstanding link between Asian Americans\u2019 feelings of social exclusion and their support for the Democratic Party.\n\nPolice misconduct trials are rare.

          "text": "That whoosh you just heard? That was House Democrats breathing a sigh of relief now that Democrat Rita Hart has withdrawn her challenge to contest the result in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, which she lost to Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks by just six votes last November \u2014 one of the closest federal elections in U.S. history.\n\nDemocrats were reportedly worried at the prospect of having to vote on whether to unseat Miller-Meeks, especially considering how loudly they protested former President Trump and Republicans\u2019 attempts to overturn the 2020 election earlier this year. Additionally, there were concerns it would undermine Democrats\u2019 efforts to pass a massive voting rights and election reform bill. That, along with the Democrats\u2019 narrow majority, suggested it was going to be very challenging for Democrats to reverse the outcome \u2014 even if they felt Hart had a valid case.\n\nThe new voting restrictions many states are considering\n\nMoreover, Republican messaging had put Democrats on the defensive. For instance, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy claimed they were trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election, while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell pointedly asked major businesses and organizations that were critical of GOP objections to the Electoral College on Jan. 6 to hold Democrats to \u201cthe same standard\u201d for contesting the Iowa result.\n\nRelated: Why Joe Manchin Is So Willing And Able To Block His Party\u2019s Goals Read more. \u00bb\n\nThe Iowa situation was pretty unusual, as contested elections are fairly uncommon nowadays \u2014 and reversing election outcomes is even rarer. As the table below shows, contested House elections were once a regular occurrence, especially in the years following the Civil War, when many disputes centered on congressional races in the South, according to data compiled by Jeffery Jenkins at the University of Southern California. But now the number has tailed off considerably, averaging barely one case every five congresses.\n\nContested elections used to be far more common Average share of U.S. House seats contested, by decade Years Congresses No. Contested Avg.

Not all contested races resulted in a different winner. The House reached its current size of 435 seats after the 1910 census, except for the 86th and 87th congresses (1959-1962), when it expanded to include at-large seats from Alaska and Hawaii. The House then returned to 435 seats after the 1960 census and the subsequent reapportionment before the 1962 election. Source: Jeffery Jenkins\n\nIn the past 50 years, the House has voted to reverse an election outcome only once: In 1985, the Democratic-controlled House investigated and recounted the votes in the 1984 election for Indiana\u2019s 8th Congressional District and determined that Democratic Rep. Frank McCloskey had won by four votes after the Republican candidate had led by 418 votes following a state-run recount. The House then voted 236 to 190 to seat McCloskey, prompting House Republicans to stage a walk-out.\n\nBut Democrats had a much larger majority in 1985 than they do today, so they could have afforded 30 or more defections when they voted to seat McCloskey. By comparison, fewer than five Democratic \u201cnays\u201d could have sunk an attempt to seat Hart because Democrats currently hold only a 219-to-211 seat majority. And some Democrats had privately \u2014 and even publicly \u2014 let it be known they didn\u2019t want to vote to unseat Miller-Meeks.\n\nIn the end, the math wasn\u2019t there for Democrats to reverse the outcome, and the potential fallout doesn\u2019t seem to have been worth it, either.\n\nConfidence Interval: Republicans Will Win Back Congress In 2022 | FiveThirtyEight\n\nPolice misconduct trials are rare.

          "text": "(Jonathan Ernst, Mark Makela/Reuters)\n\nYesterday, while writing about President Biden\u2019s late-coming conversation with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky, a thought occurred to me: Had Biden been ducking the man responsible for handing him the White House?\n\nI suppose that the answer is technically \u201cno\u201d \u2014 that distinction belongs to Donald Trump \u2014 but I think we might underestimate the extent to which the Trump\u2013Ukraine imbroglio influenced the 2020 election. That\u2019s not to say the voters were persuaded to opt for Biden or discard Trump as a result of the substance of the scandal itself. Rather, it\u2019s to suggest that it helped make Biden the choice of Democratic primary voters in early 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe impeachment was still fresh at that point, and Trump was seemingly most worried about Biden\u2019s becoming his opponent. That very likely primed Democrats to view Biden as the candidate most able to defeat Trump. Had the former vice president not been so obviously the candidate that the Trump campaign most feared, primary voters might have been less prone to coalesce around Biden as the \u201celectable\u201d candidate when the race winnowed. Biden\u2019s margins of victory in most of the swing states that he won in the general election were razor-thin. Given those margins, it\u2019s easy to imagine Trump walking away with a second term had Bernie Sanders emerged as the Democratic nominee.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that the Ukraine scandal was what cost Trump the presidency, but it seems likely that while trying to destroy Biden in a questionable phone call, Trump helped him to become the Democratic nominee, and ultimately the victor in the election. Yet another timely reminder that character is destiny."

          "title": "Georgia Election Law and Major League Baseball's Cowardly \"Stand\"",
          "text": "MLB commissioner Rob Manfred speaks to the media before announcing the All-MLB team during the MLB Winter Meetings in San Diego, Calif., December 10, 2019. (Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sport)\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) commissioner Rob Manfred announced that it would not be holding its 2021 All-Star Game or draft in Georgia as originally planned because of the state\u2019s much \u2014 and unfairly \u2014 maligned new elections law. Here\u2019s the full statement:\n\nOver the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views. I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year\u2019s All-Star Game and MLB Draft. Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box. In 2020, MLB became the first professional sports league to join the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States. We proudly used our platform to encourage baseball fans and communities throughout our country to perform their civic duty and actively participate in the voting process. Fair access to voting continues to have our game\u2019s unwavering support. We will continue with our plans to celebrate the memory of Hank Aaron during this season\u2019s All-Star festivities. In addition, MLB\u2019s planned investments to support local communities in Atlanta as part of our All-Star Legacy Projects will move forward. We are finalizing a new host city and details about these events will be announced shortly.\n\nWhat a humiliating spectacle for the league and the country. Manfred doesn\u2019t state what the MLB\u2019s problems with the bill are because he either can\u2019t or is embarrassed to have to articulate them out loud. The move comes after President Biden \u2014 who called the law \u201cJim Crow on steroids\u201d \u2014 said he agreed with the suggestion that the MLB move the All-Star Game, and as he continues to deceive the public about the legislation\u2019s contents. Here\u2019s the Washington Post\u2018s Glenn Kessler on the president\u2019s mendacity. First he quotes Biden:\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick \u2026 deciding that you\u2019re going to end voting at 5 o\u2019clock when working people are just getting off work.\u201d (March 25) \u201cAmong the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can\u2019t cast their vote after their shift is over.\u201d (March 26) \u201cYou are going to close a polling place at 5 o\u2019clock when working people just get off. This is all about keeping working folks and ordinary folks that I grew up with from being able to vote.\u201d\n\nThen Kessler responds to the president\u2019s claims:\n\nIn reality, Election Day hours were not changed and the opportunities to cast a ballot in early voting were expanded. The law made a modest change, replacing a vague phrase \u201cnormal business hours\u201d \u2014 presumed to be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. \u2014 to a more specific 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. time period. (Some rural county election offices worked only part time during the week, not a full eight-hour day, so the shift to more specific times makes it clear they must be open every weekday for at least eight hours.) But that\u2019s the minimum. Under the new law, counties have the option to extend the voting hours so voters can start casting ballots as early as 7 a.m. and as late as 7 p.m. \u2014 the same as Election Day in Georgia. Moreover, an additional mandatory day of early voting on Saturday was added and two days of early voting on Sunday were codified as an option for counties. The White House did not provide an explanation for Biden\u2019s erroneous statement, which has turned up in a news conference, an official statement and an interview. Astonishingly, at an April 1 news briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended the president\u2019s comment, incorrectly arguing \u201cit standardizes the ending of voting every day at 5, right?\u201d\n\nThe truth is that the Georgia bill codifies drop boxes for ballots as a permanent feature of the state\u2019s voting system (prior to 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic they had never been used there before), expands early voting, and institutes a voter ID requirement that is broadly supported by Americans of all races. Jim Crow it is not, much less a performance-enhancing drugged-up version of it.\n\nClearly Democrats, even the supposedly moderate and decent Joe Biden, will continue to tendentiously stoke fears and pressure private citizens in pursuit of certain political ends. It\u2019s on us, then, to show some courage in standing up to this demagoguery and standing for a pluralistic, liberal society.\n\nJust don\u2019t count on Rob Manfred to join us."

          "text": "The New York Times building in New York City, August 3, 2020. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nMichelle Goldberg, the New York Times columnist, can be thought-provoking. Take the following as an example:\n\nIf Matt Gaetz was a Democrat he'd have to resign immediately, but the Republican who pulled a gun on his wife and pressured his mistress to have an abortion is still there so maybe he can gut it outhttps://t.co/QY8YESaghg \u2014 Michelle Goldberg (@michelleinbklyn) April 2, 2021\n\nThat tweet leaves me pondering important questions like, \u201cWhich world is it that Michelle Goldberg inhabits?\u201d Because it certainly isn\u2019t this one.\n\nMatt Gaetz is a disgrace. So is Scott DesJarlais, the congressman to whom Goldberg refers. But how on earth can a New York Times columnist suggest that those two would have to resign if they were Democrats while New York governor Andrew Cuomo remains in office? Cuomo is responsible for a catastrophic policy error that led directly to the deaths of his constituents, covering up that mistake, and providing for the preferential treatment of his family during a pandemic, as well as being accused of numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. A few other names of Democrats who didn\u2019t resign that Goldberg might remember: Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Chris Dodd, Ralph Northam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obviously true that partisans of stripes both red and blue are reticent to hold their own to account. Submitting that only Republican officeholders can get away with improper or heinous acts, though, is manifestly silly."

Totally, totally fantastic.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to hear even a whisper of whining from anyone about how Christie was mean to Trump or too nice to Biden or whatever your grievance is. This is way too important and way too good. You\u2019ll watch it and you\u2019ll like it. End of discussion.\n\nBecause Christie SMASHES the lies and myths about the law. The liberal panelists KNOW it. They become FRANTIC about it.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: \u201cDrop boxes now become a permanent part of the Georgia landscape, they were not prior to Covid. They are now,\u201d he said. One of the libs pathetically tried to respond to that by saying there are not ENOUGH drop boxes.\n\nNot enough? They didn\u2019t even get rid of them? In fact they ENABLED them PERMANENTLY?? That\u2019s a preeetttttyyy long from \u201csuppression\u201d don\u2019t y\u2019all think?.\n\n\u201cMinimum of 17 days of early voting, including two Saturdays and two optional Sundays,\u201d he points out. So much for that \u201csuppressing the black voter\u201d myth about shutting down weekends.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have all voters being able to have multiple ways to prove who they are, driver\u2019s license, last four numbers of your Social Security number, even a utility bill or a free ID provided by the state of Georgia\u201d he points out. So much for \u201cAfrican-American voters won\u2019t know how to use numbers on their drivers license\u201d bigotry from the left.\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams, by the way, Stacey Abrams was in New Jersey, in my state, praising Phil Murphy this week for a voting law where New Jersey early voting is nine days. Half, half of what Georgia is. Yet she\u2019s on TV in New Jersey \u2014 I saw it myself \u2014 saying that this is one of the greatest voting expansion bills we\u2019ve ever seen, but this is Jim Crow? I\u2019m sorry, George.\u201d\n\nThat is just a KABOOM.\n\nWhen Yvette Simpson says the stupid water thing it really gets crazy.\n\n\u201cA hundred and fifty feet, where, in New Jersey, in Chicago and any place else in the country, you\u2019re not \u2014 he\u2019s saying partisan groups cannot do electioneering by giving out food and water. And in the Georgia bill says that there can be water provided by the state of Georgia, just not by partisan groups,\u201d Christie explains to the libs.\n\nSarah Isgur says it may be a dumb provision but \u201cit\u2019s not a threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nSimpson, giving the game away, says \u201cEvery time you try to restrict voting rights it\u2019s a threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nSee how they are trying to work it? Devious and evil. Isgur responds \u201cBut that\u2019s not restricting voting rights.\u201d\n\nRight. And yet the libs continue to say that it is, facts be damned.\n\nThe part where Christie just KEEPS calling Joe Biden a LIAR is also pretty great.\n\nHere\u2019s the full transcript.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Listen, it\u2019s just a symptom, George. It\u2019s a symptom of what\u2019s going on in our country right now.\n\nI mean, let\u2019s talk about what the Georgia law is really about because we haven\u2019t had much of that. Drop boxes now become a permanent part of the Georgia landscape. They were not prior to COVID. They are now.\n\nMinimum of 17 days of early voting, including two Saturdays and two optional Sundays. You\u2019re going to have all voters being able to have multiple ways to prove who they are, driver\u2019s license, last four numbers of your Social Security number, even a utility bill or a free ID provided by the state of Georgia, and voting is going to be until \u2014 from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. as it is right now in Georgia.\n\nThis is what we \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, what is this a symptom of? It sounds like you\u2019re against \u2014\n\nCHRISTIE: It\u2019s a symptom of, it\u2019s a symptom of this, George. And I hate to come in here this morning to say this because I sat here and listened to the president\u2019s inaugural address. And I just want a couple of real quick points from it.\n\nPolitics need not be a raging fire that destroys everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war, and we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated or made up.\n\nAnd Joe Biden\u2019s broken his own rule, 84 days. And now, he\u2019s lying to the American people, George. He\u2019s lying about this bill. He\u2019s lying to the American people about it to cause the raging fire he said he was going to put out. I\u2019m very disappointed.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Yvette, he did make some misstatements about the bill. The bill basically, though, restricts access to early \u2014 not to early voting but to absentee ballots, but it does expand early voting.\n\nYVETTE SIMPSON, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, it depends on how you think about it. You know, you have to pick between a Saturday or a Sunday and what we know about early voting is a lot of folks appreciate, expect and depend on that weekend voting. We know that Sundays are a time when a lot of churches do go.\n\nSo, the fact that you have to pick between the two is a challenge. It still does not address voter purging which is a big significant issue and there are not enough drop boxes, in fact. Part of the challenge was, yes, you\u2019ve solidified it, but no, you have not provided sufficient drop boxes for folks.\n\nSo, it \u2014 let\u2019s stop and back up and say, first, the motivation was not to do more. The motivation was actually to do less.\n\nWe know that voter fraud was not an issue. And so, this just the motivation enough was enough, and I don\u2019t think this goes far enough. I think that, you know, what do we need to do to make sure early voting gets expanded? Seventeen days is not enough early voting.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, Stacey Abrams, by the way, Stacey Abrams was in New Jersey, in my state, praising Phil Murphy this week for a voting law where New Jersey early voting is nine days. Half, half of what Georgia is.\n\nYet she\u2019s on TV in New Jersey \u2014 I saw it myself \u2014 saying that this is one of the greatest voting expansion bills we\u2019ve ever seen, but this is Jim Crow? I\u2019m sorry, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: She\u2019s not \u2014 she\u2019s not for moving the all-star game.\n\nBut, Sarah, one of the interesting things we\u2019re seeing here is not just Major League Baseball. It\u2019s Delta. It\u2019s Coca-Cola. It does appear here that corporate America is out of step with the Republican base.\n\nSARAH ISGUR, ABC NEWS ANALYST: That\u2019s certainly true, but I think that Republicans have stumbled on a pretty good message here which is Delta, Coke, et cetera, these corporations coming out and condemning the Georgia bill, which, as you said, is ridiculous compared to other states. Delaware, Joe Biden\u2019s home state, didn\u2019t even have early voting in 2020. They won\u2019t have it until 2022. They\u2019re condemning that. They\u2019re condemning this Georgia bill without really understanding it. Joe Biden has been labeled a recidivist liar for what he has said about the bill by the fact checking organizations.\n\nAnd what about China? We have actual concentration camps going on in China and these corporations won\u2019t say word one about it. And the hypocrisy of that, I think, is very clear to a Republican base that this isn\u2019t about whether the feel strongly about a Georgia bill that doesn\u2019t do what the Democrats are afraid it will do and it doesn\u2019t do what the Republicans want it to do, by the way. But, at the same time, unwilling to say word one about China because that\u2019s where the money is.\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d ANCHOR: They wouldn\u2019t be doing it if it wasn\u2019t in their corporate interest.\n\nYVETTE SIMPSON, DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA CEO AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.\n\nRAHM EMANUEL, (D) FORMER MAYOR OF CHICAGO AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the \u2014 you\u2019ve got to put this in a lineage. Also, if you go back four years ago, when North Carolina changed their laws as related to bathrooms, corporations then took a \u2014 pressure in isolating North Carolina. That\u2019s also the situation here. It\u2019s a shot across the bar to every other state that\u2019s looking at changing the laws. They\u2019re trying to fix the problem that did not happen.\n\nSIMPSON: Right.\n\nEMANUEL: And one of the worst part \u2014 that is the fundamental. There was no problem and they\u2019re coming up \u2014 it\u2019s like \u2014 they\u2019re coming up with the solution to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. And it\u2019s a shot across the bow to a bunch of other states. And the worst case that this bill, which none of you have mentioned, is the fact that the state legislature wants to overrule both the secretary of states (INAUDIBLE). They\u2019re \u2014 for what \u2014 what other reason. I\u2019ll repeat what I said last week, which is, if Donald Trump would have won Georgia, there\u2019d be no change in the law. And the fact that because Joe Biden won that this is \u2014 look, it\u2019s a, you know \u2014\n\nISGUR: If Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams were saying that, I think we\u2019d have a very frank (ph) conversation.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right.\n\nEMANUEL: I have no problem fixing the \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of problems to fix. This was not a problem to fix.\n\nISGUR: But they\u2019re not. Joe Biden said, it ended early voting. It doesn\u2019t end early voting.\n\nCHRISTIE: This is \u2014 it expands early voting in Georgia. The president said it ended it.\n\nListen, he\u2019s what Joe Biden\u2019s got to live with when he wakes up this morning on Easter morning. He is doing exactly what he sat around in the campaign and the transition and accused Donald Trump of doing. He is lying to cause racial divisions in this country. That\u2019s what he accused Donald Trump of doing and he\u2019s a liar and a hypocrite this morning (ph).\n\nEMANUEL: Yes, wait \u2014 so, hold on \u2014 hold on \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Then how do you explain why Major League Baseball is making the move?\n\nCHRISTIE: It\u2019s a business judgment, George. It\u2019s a business judgement. Major League Baseball has to make a decision about what is in their best business interest. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what \u2014\n\nEMANUEL: Chris \u2014\n\nCHRISTIE: I haven\u2019t spoken to anybody there, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s what this is (ph).\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: If it \u2014 if it\u2019s in their best business interest, doesn\u2019t that suggest that there\u2019s something wrong with the law?\n\nCHRISTIE: No. What it suggests is that\u2019s the climate in this country right now. That\u2019s the climate of what it is.\n\nSIMPSON: You should ask the people who know. You should ask the people who know. I\u2019ve been doing voter protection for 10 years. Just the idea that you can\u2019t give people water in line. I know people\u2019s babies \u2014\n\nCHRISTIE: No, that\u2019s just not true.\n\nISGUR: That is (INAUDIBLE) \u2014\n\nCHRISTIE: That\u2019s not true.\n\nSIMPSON: I have held people\u2019s babies while they go in to vote in order to enfranchise the vote. Do it by \u2014 do it by all (INAUDIBLE).\n\nCHRISTIE: You can\u2019t do electioneering \u2014 excuse me. That\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s just wrong.\n\nEMANUEL: I\u2019m \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, within 20 \u2014 I think it\u2019s within 25 feet.\n\nCHRISTIE: A hundred and fifty feet, where, in New Jersey, in Chicago and any place else in the country, you\u2019re not \u2014 he\u2019s saying partisan groups cannot do electioneering by giving out food and water. And in the Georgia bill says that there can be water provided by the state of Georgia, just not by partisan groups.\n\nEMANUEL: Two things, George.\n\nISGUR: Also, look, that\u2019s a stupid part of the bill, but it\u2019s not a threat to democracy.\n\nCHRISTIE: And this is the kind of stuff that \u2014\n\nEMANUEL: Two things. Two things. Two things. Two things.\n\nSIMPSON: Every time you try to restrict voting rights it\u2019s a threat to democracy.\n\nISGUR: But that\u2019s no restricting voting right.\n\nCHRISTIE: (INAUDIBLE)\n\nEMANUEL: Two things.\n\nSIMPSON: And the fact that they didn\u2019t address the elephant in the room, which is voter purging. A hundred an ninety-eight thousand African-Americans Georgians were purged from the rolls.\n\nEMANUEL: Well, wait \u2014\n\nISGUR: But that\u2019s now what Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams have been complaining of.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yes, look \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Rahm.\n\nEMANUEL: I feel like a middle child at a dinner or breakfast.\n\nSIMPSON: Always.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You really have a hard time getting in.\n\nEMANUEL: Two things.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yes, everyone feels bad for you, Rahm.\n\nEMANUEL: One is \u2014 one is you said that corporate America is out of step with the Republican Party. Corporate America has no home in the Republican Party anymore. And this is the first of many times where corporate America is going to make a clear decision. And it\u2019s a wakeup call to every other state.\n\nSecond is, Joe Biden is not a liar.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yes, he is.\n\nEMANUEL: No, no, no.\n\nSIMPSON: (INAUDIBLE).\n\nEMANUEL: And coming from a \u2014 you know, we just spent four years with a person who had literally couldn\u2019t find the truth if it actually \u2014 it went choo-choo in front of him in the morning.\n\nCHRISTIE: Is \u2014\n\nEMANUEL: Joe Biden, you may disagree with his characterization.\n\nCHRISTIE: Did we restrict early voting?\n\nEMANUEL: He is not a lie.\n\nSIMPSON: It does restrict early voting.\n\nEMANUEL: You may disagree with his characterization. That bill is only done \u2014 passed for one reason, because Joe Biden won Georgia and the two senators won Georgia.\n\nCHRISTIE: He lied. He lied, Rahm, and he\u2019s going to have to live with it.\n\nEMANUEL: That is not. He has not.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yes, he is."

Can you say anything more?\u201d Smith inquired. Biden insisted he was innocent and she politely moved on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe moved on to talk about Burisma, asking if he understood that the controversy was the dumb fault of the stupid people who could see it. \u201cOptics\u201d she said.

But today I want you to think about it from the perspective of God the Father Himself.\n\nAs we pointed out on Good Friday, this Passion of Jesus was God\u2019s rescue plan that He\u2019d begun after Adam and Eve rejected Him in the Garden. They broke our perfect communion with God, and it was God\u2019s overwhelming desire to reunite us with Himself because of His unfailing and immeasurable love for us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now that is accomplished! Jesus suffered a horrible and torturous death, becoming the one sacrifice that frees us from the bondages of sin! What Satan tried to destroy in the garden, Jesus has restored in a way that can never be undone!\n\nSo what does this really mean? It means that the Cross of Jesus is now the key that opens wide the gates of Heaven, welcoming those of us who, like the prodigal son, find our way back to God. It means that we are no longer separated from Him, that we can now be reunited with the One who loves us more than we can truly understand this side of Heaven.\n\nGod\u2019s will has been done. The chalice of His mercy has been fully poured out on His creation.\n\nI think God the Father must\u2019ve been ecstatic with joy! In human terms, I\u2019d like to think God and all the angels was doing cartwheels in Heaven after what Jesus, the Son, had accomplished. And on the morning of the resurrection, His Joy was revealed in raising Jesus from the dead, giving life to the new Church that would take this great news to the world, busting down the gates of hell and snatching more and more people from Satan\u2019s grasp!\n\nToday is indeed a day of celebration! Praise God in Heaven for what He has truly given us!"

          "text": "CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter is quite the character, and I don\u2019t mean to suggest that he\u2019s actually interesting. Rather, he\u2019s a parodic figure who embodies all the absurdities of left-wing media bias into one, larger-than-normal body.\n\nFor the past year or so, I\u2019ve observed an unwritten, self-imposed rule of not really writing about the CNN host (no, he\u2019s not a journalist by any objective definition). But sometimes he does something so ridiculous that it warrants an exception. Today was one of those days.\n\nWith Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s corrupt, crack addict son, releasing his memoir, I expected some stupid reactions from networks like CNN. I\u2019m not sure I expected this, though.\n\nDude is literally squeeing over a book by a corrupt drug addict. https://t.co/yqpEQXJKoW \u2014 Bonchie (@bonchieredstate) April 4, 2021\n\nYes, that\u2019s a grown man calling a book ostensibly written by Hunter Biden \u201cbreathtaking\u201d as if it\u2019s anything more than yet another Biden family grift. Stelter swoons over Hunter\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d journey from crack-addled corruptocrat to \u2014 hang on let me check my notes \u2014 crack-addled corruptocrat? Truly, the lack of growth is a testament to the human will.\n\nStelter then frames the bad press Hunter has received, all of which has been true and deserved, as \u201ctabloid\u201d coverage. And of course, that big bad Fox News is always picking on the president\u2019s son. I mean, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been in league with Chinese communists, got kicked out of the military for drug use, or tried to abandon a stripper he got pregnant. Oh wait, he actually did do those things.\n\nBut the real story here, as told by Stelter, is that Hunter is a victim. He\u2019s a victim of the \u201cright-wing,\u201d never mind that the negative reports about his business dealings and abandoned laptop are completely true and verified. CNN wants you to know that Hunter has changed. Heck, he wrote a book, and if you write a book to make a few million bucks off an advance, then truly, a reformation must have occurred.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the real world, Hunter Biden is every bit the low-life he\u2019s always been. No amount of squeeing from the potato section on CNN is going to change that."

          "text": "How bad has ridiculous, unevidenced COVID panic hit some people? A reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle was helpful enough to show us via his own experience. Dan Gentile was given the assignment to go watch Godzilla vs. Kong, and his description of how it went may be the most beta thing I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s also very instructive, as I\u2019ll explain.\n\nYes, people like this actually exist.\n\nI don\u2019t know Gentile\u2019s age, but judging from his picture, I\u2019d guess he\u2019s no more than 40 years old. He is also not obese (around 80% of COVID hospitalizations have happened to obese individuals). That means he\u2019s in an age and weight range that has an extremely small chance of suffering any real complications from COVID. That doesn\u2019t mean the coronavirus isn\u2019t dangerous, but it does mean the level of danger varies wildly depending on one\u2019s age and condition. Recognizing that reality should allow people to judge their risk, and act accordingly.\n\nWell, I said it should allow that. Instead, Gentile has a \u201cbiking mask,\u201d something that is completely pointless and not at all backed by science. Studies have continually shown that outdoor spread of COVID is minimal to non-existent, but it\u2019s especially non-existent when you are sitting on a bike alone, riding down the street.\n\nAt least he admits he\u2019s neurotic, so that\u2019s progress, I suppose. Yet, if people are labeling him the \u201cCOVID police,\u201d that means he\u2019s spreading his false gospel to others, chastising them for making rational choices. That\u2019s not helpful to anyone.\n\nGentile proclaims in his article that he\u2019s been surprised to learn movie theaters aren\u2019t super-spreaders.\n\nAs someone who follows entertainment news for a living, I\u2019ve been surprised not to hear of any super-spreader events linked to theaters, which would be crippling to an already kneecapped industry. A recent article in The Atlantic calls theaters a gray zone, citing several experts who say since there\u2019s little talking, masks and distancing are effective.\n\nThat\u2019s basically been the theme of the pandemic for much of the left \u2013 lots of people making lots of assumptions not at all tested or proven in any scientific manner. This is how you get outdoor venues requiring masks or schools being shut down for almost a year in New York, despite experts and real-world data showing spread is simply not a statistical issue in those situations. Meanwhile, state and local governments shoved people in their homes via lockdown orders, despite that being the place where spread is most prevalent.\n\nIn short, what Gentile\u2019s article shows is just how irrational the messaging around the coronavirus has been. We\u2019ve known since the first few months of the pandemic where the virus primarily spreads. We\u2019ve had ample real-world data on who it actually is a serious threat to for almost that long. But because fear sells, and panic provides cover for politicians, we haven\u2019t acted in a way that rationally measures risk.\n\nThus, you get guys wearing \u201cbiking masks\u201d and freaking out about going to the movies even as the pandemic is clearly waning. Welcome to America."

There are few things easier and simpler than that Acela train ride, I say, as someone who did it many times.

Specifically, what exactly did they accomplish by lying about the election reform bill except costing Georgia business owners over $100 million in revenue?\n\nStacey Abrams has been the least self-aware in the aftermath, claiming that she\u2019s not to blame despite clearly being to blame (see Stacey Abrams Shows Zero Self-Awareness in Pretending She\u2019s Not to Blame for MLB Boycott). Others like Raphael Warnock haven\u2019t even tried to pretend they don\u2019t the result.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t just Georgia-centric figures in the mix here. Joe Biden also voiced his support for the boycott, and one of his advisors was asked about it this morning. Her answer is mind-boggling.\n\nThis is what being out of touch looks like.\n\nBiden advisor Cecilia Rouse's tells Georgia small businesses affected by MLB's decision to boycott: \"workers at another place will benefit\"pic.twitter.com/NY6eYIEv1b \u2014 Julia Friedland (@JuliaFriedland) April 4, 2021\n\nOh, you mean some workers in New York City (which is being discussed as a possible relocation site for the all-star game) will benefit despite the fact that New York has stricter voting laws than Georgia? Makes sense, right?\n\nBut it\u2019s really the callousness of this answer that gets me. It tells you exactly what Biden, Democrats, and the broader left think of American workers and business owners. They aren\u2019t individual people with individual lives that can be impacted by garbage rhetoric and policy decisions. Rather, they are just cogs in the machine. As long as a set number of people jump in to make widgets, Biden and his flacks couldn\u2019t care less what happens to everyone else. It\u2019s a gross way to deal with matters, but it\u2019s what always happens as government power expands to the point of absurdity. Things become impersonal and soulless, with a focus on the \u201cgreater good\u201d than on how things affect the lives of real people.\n\nDo you know what would be helpful right now? Having an administration that cares more about telling the truth than lying about a mundane election law for political gain. None of this had to happen. This is on the heads of Stacey Abrams, Raphael Warnock, Keisha Lance-Bottoms, Joe Biden, and a myriad of mainstream media hacks who propagated a false narrative about Georgia\u2019s election reform bill.\n\nGeorgians have a chance to make things right starting in 2022. Hopefully, this episode is fresh in their minds. Warnock needs to be booted out of the Senate, and any run for governor by Abrams after that should be laughed at. These people don\u2019t care about Georgia. They care about raising their own profiles and stuffing their pockets with grifter cash."

          "text": "May all of our readers have a happy and blessed Easter celebration today, as we begin to see light at the end of a tunnel that we started entering about this time last year. We would also like to wish our Jewish readers a belated Passover greeting, as this year both events take place close to each other as they did the year before. We are still struggling through separation and isolation and looking for a resurrection this year, and our Gospel readings throughout the weekend speak to that.\n\nFor the Easter vigil, we have Mark 16:1-7, which reminds us that all separation is only temporary in the Lord:\n\nWhen the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him. Very early when the sun had risen, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb. They were saying to one another, \u201cWho will roll back the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?\u201d When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back; it was very large. On entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were utterly amazed. He said to them, \u201cDo not be amazed! You seek Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Behold the place where they laid him. But go and tell his disciples and Peter, \u2018He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the morning Mass, we have John 20:19, which picks up the story and extends our desire for seeing Jesus in the flesh:\n\nOn the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark, and saw the stone removed from the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, \u201cThey have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don\u2019t know where they put him.\u201d So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb. They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first; he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in. When Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, and the cloth that had covered his head, not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place. Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed. For they did not yet understand the Scripture that he had to rise from the dead.\n\nAnd finally in our afternoon and evening Easter Masses, we recall the disciples\u2019 journey to Emmaus, and how difficult it is for us to recognize Christ at times through our woe. Our closest communion to Him is in the breaking of the bread, as Luke writes in his Gospel (24:13-35):\n\nThat very day, the first day of the week, two of Jesus\u2019 disciples were going to a village seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus, and they were conversing about all the things that had occurred. And it happened that while they were conversing and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him. He asked them, \u201cWhat are you discussing as you walk along?\u201d They stopped, looking downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, said to him in reply, \u201cAre you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know of the things that have taken place there in these days?\u201d And he replied to them, \u201cWhat sort of things?\u201d They said to him, \u201cThe things that happened to Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, how our chief priests and rulers both handed him over to a sentence of death and crucified him. But we were hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel; and besides all this, it is now the third day since this took place. Some women from our group, however, have astounded us: they were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his body; they came back and reported that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who announced that he was alive. Then some of those with us went to the tomb and found things just as the women had described, but him they did not see.\u201d And he said to them, \u201cOh, how foolish you are! How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?\u201d Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them what referred to him in all the Scriptures. As they approached the village to which they were going, he gave the impression that he was going on farther. But they urged him, \u201cStay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.\u201d So he went in to stay with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him, but he vanished from their sight. Then they said to each other, \u201cWere not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us?\u201d So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem where they found gathered together the eleven and those with them who were saying, \u201cThe Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!\u201d Then the two recounted what had taken place on the way and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.\n\nMay this Easter Sunday leave us with our hearts burning for Him again, with our spirits refreshed in this new encounter with Christ. We are all on a path without being able to fully know where we are going or who we might meet along the way. If we keep our hearts open to Jesus, we will find the grace to find the journey\u2019s end.\n\nJesus Christ is Risen \u2014 He is Risen Indeed!\n\nThe front-page image is \u201cThe Angel is Opening Christ\u2019s Tomb\u201d by Benjamin Gerritsz Cuyp, c. 1640.

          "text": "Is it time to cancel Ken Burns at PBS? It\u2019s not easy being a white, male, cisgender filmmaker these days over at the taxpayer-funded public television network. Burns has achieved immense success for his documentaries made for PBS and has been generously rewarded for his work there. A group of nearly 140 filmmakers and other professionals is blasting PBS for a lack of diversity behind the scenes. Their complaint says there is just too much Ken Burns.\n\nA group of people that includes filmmakers, producers, directors, executives, and programmers signed on with their support after an essay by a Korean-American filmmaker was published by the Ford Foundation. The purpose was to lodge a complaint that PBS is too dependent on Burns, \u201cAmerica\u2019s storyteller\u201d, for its programming. The woke are going against their own network, in other words, because of what amounts to what looks like professional jealousy.\n\nGrace Lee, an independent producer, director, and writer working in both narrative and nonfiction film, according to her byline on the essay, credits her career to PBS. She now asks \u201chow much does PBS reflect the audiences it was intended to serve?\u201d She compares the time given to documentaries by Burns versus that of her own, which was on Asian Americans.\n\nIn 1967, amid widespread civil unrest, CPB was created by an Act of Congress \u201cto expand and develop a diversity of programming dependent on freedom, imagination and initiative on both local and national levels.\u201d PBS was founded in 1969 to interconnect public television stations and distribute programs. Fifty-one years later, as we undergo another societal breakdown and racial reckoning, how much does PBS reflect the audiences it was intended to serve? I take this question seriously because I largely owe my own documentary career to PBS. In 2020, I was a producer on Asian Americans, a groundbreaking series for which we had five hours to tell 150 years of history spanning from the Chinese who built the railroads to South Asians targeted after 9/11. Compare this to 16 hours of Country Music, which also aired in 2020, or 13 hours of the Roosevelts\u2014both by Ken Burns. His 2021 slate includes four hours each on Ernest Hemingway, Muhammad Ali, Benjamin Franklin, and the American Buffalo. When bison merit 80% of the airtime afforded to Asian American history, it calls into question not only the leadership of public television but also who gets to tell these stories, and why.\n\nShe makes her argument using the fact that Burns is a white male and the dependence on his documentaries for PBS programming is perpetuating racial and cultural inequities. She criticizes PBS for overlooking black, indigenous, and other filmmakers of color.\n\n\u201cThe decades-long interdependence of PBS decision-makers, philanthropists, and corporate funders with one white, male filmmaker highlights the racial and cultural inequities perpetuated by this system. The amount of broadcast hours, financial support (from viewers like who?), and marketing muscle devoted to one man\u2019s lens on America has severed PBS from its very roots,\u201d said Grace Lee.\n\nPBS responded but that response wasn\u2019t to the satisfaction of the group of 140 professionals.\n\nIn a statement over email, a PBS spokesperson noted that of the more than 200 primetime hours of documentaries slated to be aired this year, 35 percent are produced by diverse filmmakers. A total of 55 percent feature BIPOC talent, are produced by diverse filmmakers or cover topics related to diversity, equity and inclusion. \u201cFor over 50 years, reflecting the full range of the American experience has been central to the mission and work of PBS. As America\u2019s home for documentaries, we use our national platform to amplify a broad array of perspectives shared by diverse storytellers,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cWhile we have a strong foundation of inclusive programming, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we welcome ongoing dialogue on this critically important issue.\u201d\n\nThe group has questions.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of the public broadcasting system, you are responsible to commit to an open and sustained public dialogue. Questioning whether PBS could be doing better should not be seen as an attack, but as an opportunity for meaningful dialogue and action, and to engage BIPOC filmmakers as we chart a course forward,\u201d said the letter, which asks: \u201cHow many HOURS of PBS non-fiction television have been directed or produced by BIPOC filmmakers vs. by white filmmakers over the past ten years? Of all SPENDING on PBS non-fiction television over the past ten years, what percentage has been directed or produced by BIPOC filmmakers? Of the top 25 production companies that have produced the most content for PBS over the past ten years when measured according to budget, how many of them are BIPOC-led vs. white-led? How many PBS management staff (including individual stations and major strands) are BIPOC vs. white? How do these numbers compare to the numbers from ten years ago?\u201d\n\nThe AP reports that PBS President and CEO said, \u201cI feel very privileged to have the opportunity to work with Ken Burns, whose legacy is extraordinary and as we look forward, has a very rich pipeline of programs that he\u2019s bringing to public television.\u201d\n\nPresident and CEO Paula Kerger was asked Tuesday about an essay by filmmaker Grace Lee, who contended that public TV\u2019s deep attachment to Burns, whose series include \u201cThe Civil War\u201d and \u201cBaseball,\u201d slights viewers of color. \u201cI feel very privileged to have the opportunity to work with Ken Burns, whose legacy is extraordinary and as we look forward, has a very rich pipeline of programs that he\u2019s bringing to public television,\u201d Kerger said in a virtual Q&A with the Television Critics Association. \u201cWe create lots of opportunities for many filmmakers,\u201d Kerger said. Burns \u201cmentors a number of filmmakers who now have quite established careers \u2026 and he has a deep commitment to mentoring diverse filmmakers.\u201d She said she \u201crespectfully disagrees\u201d with Lee\u2019s arguments in a essay last fall for the Ford Foundation.\n\nWhen asked during a panel of television critics this week, Ken Burns defended the subjects of his documentaries. \u201cThe stuff that\u2019s coming up is incredibly diverse in every sense of the meaning of that word,\u201d Burns said.\n\nKen Burns isn\u2019t known as a liberal filmmaker in the sense that Michael Moore or Spike Lee is. Maybe that is why he is being singled. PBS has the right to choose whomever they want to showcase. Burns has decades of professional experience and deserves the credit he receives. His documentaries are popular and bring high ratings for PBS. Why wouldn\u2019t they keep using him as their star documentarian? Ms. Lee was given an opportunity and even admits she has PBS to thank for airing her documentary. The relationship between PBS and Burns is beneficial for both parties. Burns isn\u2019t jumping to streaming services, instead pledging his loyalty to staying with PBS. PBS gives him the creative freedom and fewer restraints than, say, Netflix or another streaming service would be able to allow.\n\n\u201cI could have gone a few years ago to a streaming channel or premium cable, and say, with my track record, \u2018I need $30 million to do Vietnam,\u2019 and they would have given me,\u201d Burns said. \u201cBut what they wouldn\u2019t have given me is 10 and a half years. PBS gave me 10 and a half years. They gave me six and a half on Ernest Hemingway.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like Ms. Lee is going to have to find her own niche in the documentary-making business. Blaming race and diversity for everything doesn\u2019t always work."

          "text": "Have you ever had one of those moments when it seems as if you\u2019ve slipped through some sort of dimensional doorway into an alternate reality, as happened in some of the original episodes of the Twilight Zone? Reading some of the liberal editorials making the rounds these days can produce a similar effect. That\u2019s what happened when a reader sent me a link to this editorial in the Boston Globe written by Marcela Garcia, a member of the paper\u2019s editorial board. The subject was immigration (carefully avoiding using the word \u201cillegal\u201d anywhere in the column) and the author was seeking to find an explanation as to why President Joe Biden was being too tough on immigrants and not relaxing restrictions on immigration. I\u2019ll just give you a moment to collect yourselves after that shock to the system.\n\nThe official name of the malady is xenophobia. Donald Trump did everything he could to spread the condition, and it still infects us. Unlike Trump, President Biden doesn\u2019t fear displaced foreigners who fled their homes due to civil conflict, natural disasters, persecution, or systemic violence. Nor does he blatantly use them as handy political props. Still, he may be afraid of appearing soft on immigration, just as some were labeled soft on crime a generation ago. That could be one explanation for why Biden hasn\u2019t reversed Trump\u2019s historically low refugee admissions cap of 15,000 annually, leaving many in the resettlement world baffled. It could also be that the administration is consumed with managing the influx of migrant children at the US-Mexico border.\n\nGarcia goes on to describe Biden\u2019s \u201cdelay on welcoming refugees\u201d as being a \u201chuge disappointment\u201d to advocates like herself. To her credit, the author does draw a distinction between people who have left their home countries and traveled through a second nation, applying for the United Nations refugee resettlement program along the way, and those who simply show up at our border demanding asylum. The former qualify as refugees in the technical sense and are at least trying to comply with our laws, while the latter are illegal immigrants. But that credit is diminished when the author turns around and basically lumps both categories into the same basket.\n\nDonald Trump did indeed lower the cap on the number of refugees America accepts. That move turned out to be rather prescient when you consider the effects of the pandemic and the measures we were forced to take in bringing it under control. And while we\u2019re making some admirable progress, the pandemic is still with us. Many of the countries these refugees hail from still have alarming infection rates.\n\nBut if Ms. Garcia wants to talk about the total number of refugees of any description that are being \u201callowed\u201d into our country currently, perhaps she should take a look at the latest news from the southern border. In case anyone has somehow missed it, thanks to Joe Biden\u2019s changes to our immigration policies we are currently \u201cwelcoming\u201d so many people into our country that we have nowhere to put them and many are being released into the country without a court date and some without even having been ID\u2019d for a background check. The author is concerned that the refugee cap isn\u2019t being raised from 15,000 to 65,000, but the Border Patrol currently estimates that they will end up dealing with more than a million illegal alien encounters by the end of this year.\n\nDoes any sane person honestly believe that Joe Biden is mismanaging the crisis on the southern border because he\u2019s \u201cafraid of looking soft on illegal immigration?\u201d Before even taking office, Biden did everything short of going down to the border and literally rolling out a red carpet. And the aspiring illegal immigrants have taken his invitation to heart, wearing their Biden campaign t-shirts and giving press conferences about how hard it is to get their official documents and spread across the nation.\n\nJoe Biden is hardly afraid of being seen as being too soft on any border control and immigration policies. He ran his entire campaign on promised to be precisely that guy. Now he\u2019s made good on those promises and we have him to thank for the burgeoning crap show currently unfolding on the Mexican border."

          "text": "An update to last week\u2019s post about case counts declining in the Lone Star state. Not only have cases continued to fall in Texas since then, the seven-day average is now the lowest it\u2019s been since June 18, 2020 according to Worldometer. Yesterday the state was averaging just 3,263 daily confirmed infections. On March 10, the day Greg Abbott\u2019s order lifting Texas\u2019s mask mandate took effect, it was averaging 4,895.\n\nAverage daily deaths are also the lowest they\u2019ve been since November \u2014 and deaths lag cases by several weeks so they might well continue to fall throughout April.\n\nIs there a \u201cvaccine effect\u201d at work here? Well, sure, partly. Every person that\u2019s vaccinated is almost completely immune from infection and millions of Texans have been vaccinated by now. But if inoculations were driving this, we\u2019d expect to see cases falling even more dramatically in states with higher vaccination rates than Texas and we don\u2019t. On the contrary: Just 27 percent of Texans have received at least one dose, which places it in the bottom 10 of U.S. states by that measure. Michigan has immunized 30 percent of its population and it\u2019s enduring the nastiest wave in the country right now.\n\nGotta be more to Texas\u2019s brightening outlook than vaccines, then. Last week I speculated that there\u2019s a weather effect suppressing cases in the south: Since it\u2019s warmer there now than in the north, people are spending more time outdoors, reducing transmission. Here\u2019s a map to show you what I mean based on this NYT tracker. States in blue are where cases are either beginning to rise or already \u201chigh and staying high,\u201d per the Times. States in red are where cases are \u201clow and staying low.\u201d There\u2019s a clear pattern, notwithstanding a few outliers;\n\nWeather\u2019s not the only variable, obviously. Florida\u2019s an outlier because it has an unusually high number of cases involving the more contagious British variant. But it\u2019s the one and only state along the southern border that\u2019s seeing an uptick right now.\n\nBack to Texas. Apple\u2019s mobility data also suggests more outdoor activity there lately, as there\u2019s been a surge in walking route requests relative to January 2020, before the pandemic began. As the weather gets warmer, people are naturally more willing to be out in the open air.\n\nIn Michigan, by comparison, walking route requests are up only 42 percent from January 2020. Meanwhile, despite Abbott lifting the mask mandate and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity, Texans aren\u2019t spending noticeably more time in commercial spaces now. From Google\u2019s mobility data:\n\nMore time outdoors and *not* much more time, if any, in indoor public spaces: That seems to be Texas\u2019s successful formula lately. Abbott may have given them the green light to take more risks but they seem to be holding back, possibly because the vaccine is now generally available and it\u2019s silly to stop taking precautions when you may be only weeks or days away from being immunized.\n\nVery much relatedly, Texans also don\u2019t seem to be cutting back on wearing masks even though state law no longer requires them to do so. Quote:\n\nJames Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, says the newest poll his team is working on shows that Texans mask usage hasn\u2019t dropped drastically since the mandate ended. \u201cWe still have about 80% of Texans, as recently as this month, reporting that they are wearing masks when they go out,\u201d Henson said\u2026 In February, 81% of Republicans and 98% of Democrats said they wear a mask when in close contact with people outside of their household.\n\nGood news. Not so good news: The same poll shows 25 percent of Texas Democrats are reluctant or opposed to getting the vaccine versus \u2026 59 percent of Texas Republicans, a clear majority of the party. In theory, Texas will never have another wave of COVID because the state will reach herd immunity before the outdoors becomes unbearably hot again, driving people inside. In practice, there may be enough vaccine refuseniks still holding out come June to seed another major statewide outbreak among the unimmunized. And there\u2019s no reason to think Texas is the only red state where that\u2019ll be true.\n\nIn fact, we could see two-track pandemics in various Republican states this summer, with bluer urban areas relatively safe due to higher vaccination rates and more mask-wearing by locals and redder rural areas more at risk due to fewer masks and lower vaccine uptake. A Twitter pal pointed out this morning that, while Texas\u2019s cases statewide are down, there\u2019s early evidence that the trend may be reversing in rural areas already:\n\nYou are throwing your own political group under the bus. The urban areas are doing well because they have good (or better) mask compliance. Some of the rural areas are heating up very rapidly. Hospitalizations are a trailing indicator. These will uptick soon in these areas. pic.twitter.com/dvhazTd9Jh \u2014 Carrick Talmadge (@carrick510) April 3, 2021\n\nSoutherners (and Californians) have been given a respite from the pandemic by their climates that most of the rest of the country doesn\u2019t get to enjoy. If they take advantage by using that respite to get immunized en masse, they\u2019ll beat COVID before another summer wave can gather. If they squander it by resisting the vaccine due to whatever odd suspicions they have about it, they\u2019ll be back in the soup when the weather turns again. I think it really is as simple as that."
