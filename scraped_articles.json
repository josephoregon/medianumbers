          "title": "How safe is it to go to the beach now? What you should know",
          "text": "Editor's Note \u2014 Since the pandemic continues, CNN is not advising that people do these activities. But if you're going to, there are ways to mitigate risks. Fully vaccinated people are, of course, at much lower risk of contracting and spreading coronavirus than people who haven't been vaccinated. CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen advises approaching your activity decisions with that in mind.\n\n(CNN) \u2014 With summer around the corner and more people getting Covid-19 vaccines, you may be wondering whether going to the beach is a safe bet.\n\nEven for people who have been fully vaccinated, \"nothing is going to be 100% safe, just like nothing is going to be 100% risk,\" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. However, beaches \"are much safer than other settings because they are outdoors.\"\n\nPictured is St. Kilda beach in Dunedin, New Zealand. As the world slowly reopens, visiting beaches can be safer than traveling to indoor destinations. Shutterstock\n\n\"We have not seen that (coronavirus) can be spread in the water,\" said Dr. Ada Stewart, a family physician with Cooperative Health in Columbia, South Carolina, and the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. Whether you're at the beach by yourself or with fully vaccinated family or friends, Stewart added, what helps reduce risk is having your own area to relax in.\n\nAlways check the regulations of the local government, public health office and beach in advance, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended . The beach managers may be requiring reservations or limited capacity. Also, plan to arrive \"swim ready\" by showering and changing at home first.\n\nFor times when you may have to be closer to people -- like when you visit the restroom or concession stand -- wear a mask, carry hand sanitizer and wash your hands. The CDC has advised beach managers to ensure there is enough equipment -- such as chairs and other supplies -- for visitors and that everything is cleaned regularly. However, bringing hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray or wipes would be useful for cleaning equipment yourself.\n\nIf you need to shower or rinse off at the beach, try to physically distance from others or go in when the area isn't crowded. Bring an extra mask in case your first mask gets wet; according to the CDC, a wet mask is less effective. And don't wear your mask in the water, since a wet mask can also make breathing difficult\n\nDistance yourself -- on land and in water -- from people who don't live with you. Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor areas.\n\nCoronavirus commonly spreads through respiratory droplets during close physical contact, so Wen is more worried \"about what happens if people leave the beach and end up going to the bar.\" Even if people are distanced in places like indoor bars and restaurants, wearing a mask is still best if you might be sharing air."

          "title": "Another US Covid-19 surge may look different, experts say, particularly for younger people. Here's how",
          "text": "(CNN) Experts say Covid-19 vaccinations i n the US are going extremely well -- but not enough people are protected yet and the country may be at the start of another surge.\n\nThe US reported a record over the weekend with more than 4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in 24 hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnd the country now averages more than 3 million doses daily, according to CDC data.\n\nBut only about 18.5% of Americans are fully vaccinated, CDC data shows, and Covid-19 cases in the country have recently seen concerning increases.\n\n\"I do think we still have a few more rough weeks ahead,\" Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist and epidemiologist, told CNN on Sunday. \"What we know from the past year of the pandemic is that we tend to trend about three to four weeks behind Europe in terms of our pandemic patterns.\"\n\nWhat's worse, experts say, is that the variant is changing the pandemic's playbook and could spell trouble for younger groups that haven't yet been vaccinated.\n\n\"We have to think about the B.1.1.7 variant as almost a brand new virus,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \"It's acting differently from anything we've seen before, in terms of transmissibility, in terms of affecting young people, so we have to take this very seriously.\"\n\nCDC director says variants causing cases to rise\n\nCovid-19 cases have increased for a fourth straight week, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday at the White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing.\n\n\"We know that these increases are due, in part, to more highly transmissible variants, which we are very closely monitoring,\" Walensky said.\n\nShe also said that a number of the clusters identified among young people are connected to participation in youth sports and extracurricular activities. The CDC guidelines suggest those activities should be limited.\n\n\"I understand that people are tired and that they are ready for this pandemic to be over, as am I,\" Walensky said. \"Please, continue to hang in there, and to continue to do things that we know prevent the spread of the virus.\"\n\nThe difference between previous surges and another possible surge now is \"the people most affected now are the younger individuals,\" emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN on Sunday.\n\nOlder populations have been prioritized nationwide for Covid-19 vaccinations. More than 54% of Americans 65 and older have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC , while more than 75% of that same age group have gotten at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose.\n\nBut while that age group is now relatively well protected, Wen said, younger groups are still vulnerable as the B.1.1.7 variant circulates. The variant is more contagious and may cause a more severe iteration of the disease, experts have said. Research suggests it may also be more deadly.\n\n\"We're seeing in places like Michigan that the people who are now getting hospitalized by large numbers are people in their 30s and 40s,\" Wen said. \"And now we're even seeing children getting infected in larger numbers, too.\"\n\nIt's not just Michigan.\n\n\"What we're seeing is pockets of infection around the country, particularly in younger people who haven't been vaccinated, and also in school-aged children,\" former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\n\"If you look what's happening in Michigan, in Minnesota, in Massachusetts, for example, you're seeing outbreaks in schools and infections in social cohorts that haven't been exposed to the virus before.\"\n\n\"The infection is changing its contours in terms of who's being stricken by it right now,\" he added.\n\nIn Florida's Orange County, officials reported late last month a rise in Covid-19 cases in the 18-to-25 age group.\n\nAnd a third of all of the county's Covid-19 hospitalizations were people younger than 45, according to Dr. Raul Pino, director of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County.\n\nNew Jersey officials said last week that variants, including the B.1.1.7 strain, were contributing to a rise in cases and hospitalizations -- including in younger age groups.\n\nBetween the first and last weeks of March, there was a 31% and 48% increase, respectively, in the number of hospitalizations among the 20-29 and 40-49 age groups, state health commissioner Judy Persichilli said Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile older residents only saw single-digit percent increases, she added.\n\nLifeguard calls to swimmers on a beach in the South Beach neighborhood in Florida on March 27.\n\nHow we can curb another surge of infections\n\nDespite alarming warning signs, the US is not powerless, experts have stressed.\n\nDoubling down on safety measures -- masking up, social distancing, avoiding crowds -- coupled with quick and efficient vaccinations, can help curb another Covid-19 surge, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Saturday.\n\n\"We say it over and over again and we need the local people, we need the governors and the mayors and others to be able to say, 'We're not out of it yet,'\" Fauci said.\n\n\"People say, 'Well, you just want to confine us forever.' No, this is not going to last forever because every day that you get four million, three million people vaccinated, you get closer and closer to control.\"\n\nHotez estimated Sunday that Americans need to hold on for \"another four to six weeks, and then we'll be on the other side of it.\"\n\n\"All the vaccines seem to work just as well against this UK-B.1.1.7 variant ... so that is really good news,\" he said. \"I have a lot of confidence that we're going to be in a really good place by the summer.\"\n\n\"But if you're not vaccinated, you have to behave as though you're highly vulnerable to this virus. This is not a time to get sick,\" Hotez added.\n\nSpring break travel soars\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration says it screened 1.54 million people at airports across the country on Sunday, just shy of a pandemic record set Friday when 1.58 million people flew. More than 6 million people have flown since Thursday.\n\nSunday's screening rate is more than ten times greater than the bottomed-out figures of a year ago, but still well below 2019 levels. TSA figures have been higher than 1.5 million for three of the last seven days and higher than one million for 25 days in a row.\n\nOn Friday, the CDC said those who are fully vaccinated can now travel at low risk to themselves, but said non-essential travel should still be avoided."

          "text": "(CNN) Vaccine eligibility in the US is expanding quickly, and so is the popularity of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's little white card .\n\nWhile plans to establish standardized vaccination proof are still being developed , many are holding to their Covid-19 vaccine cards as a potential form of social currency.\n\nAnd companies, like Staples and Office Depot , are offering to help keep them safe with free lamination\n\nWhile it may be tempting to get your vaccine card laminated as soon as possible, you should take your time and make sure you've considered a few things beforehand.\n\nHere's what you should know about laminating your coveted vaccine card.\n\nDouble check your information\n\nIf you are getting a two-dose vaccine, make sure that you receive and document both doses on your card before laminating it.\n\nDouble check all of your information -- including your name, date of birth, and the date and location of the vaccine -- for accuracy.\n\nMake sure you have a backup\n\nYou should definitely create a backup of your card before laminating it.\n\nDr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, told CNN that she recommends taking a photo of the card after each dose.\n\n\"Take a picture after getting the first shot, then after the second one too, in case you lose the physical card,\" she said. \"Keep the picture on your phone, and email yourself a copy to be safe.\"\n\nWen said she also recommends photocopying the card and keeping it in the same place as other important documents, like your birth certificate.\n\nAfter this, if you want to laminate your card, Wen says to \"go for it.\"\n\nKnow what to do if your card gets damaged or lost\n\nThere are concerns that the lamination process might damage cards, smudging the ink or making it illegible.\n\nBut even if your card is damaged in the lamination process, there are options.\n\nIn the case of damage to, or loss of your card, you'll need to contact your vaccine provider to get another one.\n\nIf you're having trouble contacting your provider, you can visit the CDC directory of state health department immunization information systems (IIS).\n\nWhile the CDC itself doesn't have vaccination record information, providers are required to report vaccinations to their state's respective IIS or registry. Contact your state's listed phone number or email address to access your record and get your new card.\n\nProof is the most important thing -- laminated or not\n\nSome worry that getting their vaccine cards laminated will cause trouble in the future if Covid-19 vaccine booster shots are needed.\n\nStill, Wen says don't worry.\n\n\"If you do end up getting a booster after, you can always get a different card,\" she said. \"I wouldn't let that be a deterrent.\"\n\nUltimately, the thing that trumps all is proof -- laminated or not.\n\n\"Lamination isn't necessary if you follow all the other steps above, too,\" Wen said. \"The key is to have proof of vaccination easily accessible.\""

Blinken was expected to announce in Washington.\n\nMs. Smith helped lead the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 that swept across borders in West Africa, and into the United States, while the World Health Organization was stunted by staffing cuts and other resources shortages. The Trump administration withdrew from the United Nations\u2019 health agency last year for refusing to blame China for failing to stop Covid-19 where it originated, but the United States has recommitted to working with the W.H.O. under President Biden."

Rehnquist, from 1986 to 2005; and finally jumped to just over 81 percent under Chief Justice Roberts, who joined the court in 2005.)\n\nThe kinds of cases the court is hearing have changed, too. In the Warren court, all of the rulings in favor of religion benefited minority or dissenting practitioners. In the Roberts court, most of the religious claims were brought by mainstream Christians.\n\nThe five most pro-religion justices all sit on the current court, the study found.\n\n\u201cThe justices who are largely responsible for this shift are Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cWhile there are some differences among these justices, and Kavanaugh has been involved in only a handful cases, they are clearly the most pro-religion justices on the Supreme Court going back at least until World War II.\u201d All are Republican appointees.\n\nIn the last term alone, the court sided with Christian religious groups in three argued cases. The court ruled that state programs supporting private schools must include religious ones, that the Trump administration could allow employers with religious objections to deny contraception coverage to female workers and that employment discrimination laws do not apply to many teachers at religious schools.\n\nAnd the court will soon decide whether Philadelphia may bar a Catholic agency that refused to work with same-sex couples from screening potential foster parents."

While millions of lower-income families and individuals continue to face financial hardship due to COVID-19 and the economic fall-out, those at the top in large measure continued to prosper during these hard times \u2014 a dichotomy that has become known as the \u201cK-shaped\u201d recovery.[17]\n\nRaising taxes on those struggling during this crisis could create headwinds for the recovery, but a corporate tax hike would predominantly fall on those wealthier people who have already recovered from (or never experienced) the recession. A robust and equitable recovery requires that policymakers prioritize still-struggling households, and that\u2019s precisely what raising corporate revenue to fund public investments will do.\n\nThe entire report lays out the reasons why Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan will help the country, and raising taxes on corporations will not hurt jobs, the recovery, and the broader economy.\n\nFor instance, the economy will be helped more by the growth in jobs and economic activity resulting in infrastructure investment than it could be hurt by raising taxes on corporations. A tax increase on corporations would also add more fairness to the tax code.\n\nAll of the Republican fearmongering about raising taxes to pay for infrastructure is not based on fact. Republicans are lying. The Biden infrastructure and jobs plan would be a boon to the economy.\n\nRepublicans will not be swayed by reality, but the report is evidence that President Biden is right to push full speed ahead with his plan.\n\nFor more discussion about this story join our Rachel Maddow and MSNBC group.\n\nFollow and Like PoliticusUSA on Facebook"

Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order.\" \u2014 Burgess Everett (@burgessev) April 5, 2021\n\nMitch McConnell is a leader in a political party that depends on donations from the wealthiest Americans and corporations for its survival, so it seems that the power in this situation rests with the corporations, which, if they chose to do so, could turn off the money supply to McConnell and the Republican Party at any time.\n\nSen. McConnell can\u2019t do much to anyone as the Senate Minority Leader. He can make speeches on the Senate floor or go on Fox News, but he doesn\u2019t control what bills make it to the Senate floor anymore or what gets a final vote.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s threat is empty. There is little that he can do to corporate America.\n\nThe \u201cpro-business\u201d Republican Party has reached a point where they are threatening businesses who said that every eligible American should have equal access to the ballot box, and those voting laws that target minorities are wrong and need to be changed.\n\nThat is the entire position that has Republicans outraged.\n\nMitch McConnell is threatening corporate America because they won\u2019t turn a blind eye toward Republican racism.\n\nFor more discussion about this story join our Rachel Maddow and MSNBC group.\n\nFollow and Like PoliticusUSA on Facebook"

And in the United States, former President Donald Trump lowered the U.S. rate from 35% to 21%. Trump argued that higher tax rates were incentivizing companies to relocate their operations offshore. Yellen\u2019s speech comes as President Joe Biden continues to try and draw support for his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal, which comes on the heels of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.\n\n\u201cTogether we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity,\u201d Yellen will say."

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) on Monday said FBI agents recently approached him with allegations he knew to be false, causing him to believe that the recent claims against his ex-boss are also untrue.\n\nAgents went to the home of Nathan Nelson on March 31 to question him about accusations against Gaetz, which reportedly include a claim that he paid for sex with a minor. But the agents asserted to Nelson that he resigned from Gaetz\u2019s office because of knowledge about wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cNothing could be further from the truth. Neither I nor any other member of Congressman Gaetz\u2019s staff had any knowledge of illegal activities,\u201d Nelson, who worked with Gaetz for over six years when he was a state lawmaker and another four years in Congress, told reporters during a press conference.\n\n\u201cThis baseless claim against me leaves me further convinced that the allegations against Congressman Gaetz are likewise fabricated and merely an attempt to discredit a very vocal conservative,\u201d Nelson added later.\n\nNelson said his departure in the fall of 2020 was planned and he wanted people to know what he believes to be true based on his encounter with the agents. He said he remains \u201cloosely affiliated\u201d with Gaetz\u2019s office as an unpaid adviser. He said he has not spoken to Gaetz in several months.\n\nThe FBI has referred The Epoch Times to the Department of Justice when questioned about the reported Gaetz investigation. The department hasn\u2019t returned requests for comment.\n\nThe briefing from Nelson was the latest effort to push back on the allegations against Gaetz and his office. After the allegations first became public through an anonymously-sourced report in the New York Times, Gaetz went on Fox News to say his family were victims of an extortion attempt.\n\n\u201cOver the past several weeks, my family and I have been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million while threatening to smear my name. We have been cooperating with federal authorities in this matter and my father has even been wearing a wire at the FBI\u2019s direction to catch these criminals,\u201d Gaetz said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe planted leak to the New York Times tonight was intended to thwart that investigation. No part of the allegations against me are true, and the people pushing these lies are targets of the ongoing extortion investigation. I demand the DOJ immediately release the tapes, made at their direction, which implicate their former colleague in crimes against me based on false allegations.\u201d\n\nDocuments published by the Washington Examiner indicated a group tried to obtain $25 million from Gaetz\u2019s father, former state Sen. Don Gaetz, in return for making Rep. Gaetz\u2019s \u201cfuture legal and political problems go away.\u201d\n\nDon McGee, a Florida lawyer allegedly involved in the scheme, has denied Gaetz\u2019s counter-accusations. Another man, former Air Force officer Bob Kent, said Monday he was part of the group but denied that what happened amounted to extortion."

          "text": "Shrinking Mortgage Market Could Cost California Economy $2.3 Billion a Year\n\nCommentary\n\nMortgage originations tied to refinancing activity in the U.S. are expected to plummet 76 percent from 2020 to 2022, according to a recent projection from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).\n\nThis might be particularly bad for California, which has a relatively high proportion of its workforce working as loan officers.\n\nRefinance-related mortgage originations are projected to fall from $2.4 trillion in 2020 to $1.52 trillion this year, the MBA\u2019s analysis says. The figure will plunge a further 62 percent from 2021 to next year, when the MBA projects refi-related mortgage originations to be just $573 billion.\n\nThis might be dire news for loan officers in California, whose job losses might have repercussions across the broader California economy.\n\nSoftening the blow in what is forecast to be a rapidly declining refinance sector, loan originations tied to home purchases are expected to increase 21 percent from 2020 to 2022. Loan activity related to home purchases is expected to increase 16 percent, from $1.43 trillion in 2020 to $1.67 trillion this year. It is expected to increase another four percent to $1.74 trillion in 2022.\n\nThe MBA\u2019s expected change in overage mortgage activity\u2014combining the 76 percent decrease in refi activity with the 21 percent increase in mortgages related to home purchases\u2014the overall mortgage market is forecast to shrink from $3.83 trillion in 2020 to $2.13 trillion in 2022, a 44 percent decline.\n\nCalifornia Situation\n\nThis matters more broadly in California than elsewhere because a relatively high proportion of Californians work as loan officers, and earn 25 percent more than the average worker.\n\nFurthermore, for every loan officer who loses his or her job, another 3.6 jobs are lost.\n\nAccording to the analysis conducted for the Epoch Times, the cost to the California economy from the shrinking mortgage market could reach $2.3 billion per year.\n\nAccording to a 2019 analysis conducted by the Economic Policy Institute, every job loss in the finance sector leads to another 1.5 jobs lost in sectors that support finance jobs. An additional 2.1 jobs are lost in sectors utilized by those finance people.\n\nIn California, two out of 1,000 workers are loan officers.\n\nThis might not sound high but it is the second-highest proportion in the nation, behind only North Carolina, which has two large banking hubs in an otherwise low-population state.\n\nThe concern for California is that loan officers\u2019 lost wages and spending can lead to a \u201cnegative multiplier effect\u201d\u2014the idea that reduced economic activity in their sector may cause reduced economic activity in other sectors where they spend money and rely on services.\n\nAs of May 2019\u2014the period for which the most recent data is currently available\u2014loan officers in California earned 26 percent more than other workers in California. At that time, the \u201cannual mean wage,\u201d or average annual income, across California was about $61,300 per year. Loan officers, however, were earning $77,300 per year.\n\nThere are currently 17.3 million people working in California, and if 2 out of 1,000 are loan officers, it means there are about 34,700 loan officers in the state.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that not all loan officers work within the mortgage sector; many work in banks and other lending institutions.\n\nBut given the large number of mortgage companies based in California, it is a reasonable assumption that half of all loan officers are doing mortgage-related work.\n\nThat means about 7,600 California loan officers who were working in 2020 could lose their jobs by the end of 2022.\n\nThey were earning an average of $77,300 each, accounting for $587 million a year in lost wages throughout the state.\n\nIf you factor in the 3.6 jobs lost from each loan officer no longer working or spending their earnings, at an average annual salary of $61,300, an additional $1.68 billion could be lost.\n\nIn total, the California economy could suffer a blow of some $2.3 billion per year compared to 2020 as interest rates rise and fewer people refinance their preexisting mortgages.\n\nHope for the Future\n\nOf course, during the next two years, hopes are high that the economy will re-open more broadly, international students will return for in-person instruction and amusement parks and sports venues will all lead to a spending boost. This will likely be a stronger \u201cadd\u201d to the California economy than any \u201csubtraction\u201d caused by any contraction in loan officers losing their jobs.\n\nHowever, the lending sector may not be as robust during the next two years as it was throughout the past two years."

Allred/Deseret News via AP)\n\nUtah Governor Signs Legislation Making Fathers Help Pay With Pregnancy Costs\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation into law on Monday legally requiring biological fathers to help with paying medical costs in the pregnancy if the biological mother requests it.\n\nThe legislation, House Bill 113, has been backed by Utah Republicans, Rep. Brady Brammer and Sen. Dan McCay. It received widespread support in the GOP-controlled chamber.\n\nFathers are required in accordance with the new law to pay 50 percent of a mother\u2019s insurance premiums and other pregnancy-related medical costs\u2014including the hospital birth of the child\u2014that isn\u2019t paid by another person.\n\nAccording to the bill, it will only apply to fathers whose paternity can be confirmed.\n\nIf an abortion is performed without the consent of the father, he won\u2019t be financially responsible unless the termination of the pregnancy was necessary to prevent the death of the mother or if the pregnancy was the result of rape.\n\nIn March last year, former Utah Gov. Gary Herbert signed House Bill 136 into law which would ban abortion in the state after 18 weeks gestation, with some exceptions.\n\nGovernor of Utah Gary Herbert speaks during Salt Lake Opening Night Screening Of \u201cThe Boy Who Harnessed The Wind\u201d Presented By Zions Bank during 2019 Sundance Film Festival at Rose Wagner Theatre in Park City, Utah, on Jan. 25, 2019. (Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)\n\nThe exceptions to the 18-week ban are in the case that doctors determine a fetus is not viable, that giving birth to the child would put a mother at serious risk, and in the case of rape and incest.\n\nBrammer, who sponsored House-Bill 113, said he had grown frustrated with the number of merely \u201canti-abortion\u201d measures going through the Legislature and wanted to pursue legislation that would make it easier to bring life into the world.\n\n\u201cWe want to help people and actually be pro-life in how we do it as opposed to anti-abortion,\u201d Brammer said. \u201cOne of the ways to help with that was to help the burden of pregnancy be decreased.\u201d\n\nAccording to Utah\u2019s Planned Parenthood Association and sponsors of the bill, the state appears to be the first in mandating prenatal child support.\n\nRepublican Rep. Brady Brammer, poses for a portrait at the Utah State Capitol on Jan. 30, 2020, in Salt Lake City. (Rick Bowmer/AP Photo)\n\nThe move has been applauded by pro-life activists, saying it will protect the lives of unborn children by supporting women through their pregnancy.\n\nAbortion activists and Democratic lawmakers have questioned the new law on whether it will actually help to cover costs and if it will actually meet women\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cIn the grand scheme of things, having a child and raising them to adulthood is going to be a lot more money,\u201d Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Katrina Barker said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nFrom NTD News"

          "text": "GOP States Expand School Choice as Lockdowns Boost Alternatives\n\nSeveral Republican-led states are advancing school choice programs amidst a growth of alternative learning arrangements spurred by pandemic-related lockdowns.\n\nThe new measures sometimes build on already established programs, expanding access to education savings accounts and scholarships, allowing more parents to pull their children from public schools and have the programs help pay for a private school, homeschooling, or even a private tutor.\n\nSuch initiatives now have a potential to gain more popularity as parents have been dissatisfied with the way many schools handled the response to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus pandemic, according to Jonathan\u200b Butcher, education researcher at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.\n\nCommonly, public schools switched to partly or fully remote learning last year, which has proved to be substantially less effective than in-person instruction. Many parents have blamed schools for dragging their feet with reopening, even after health authorities acknowledged that it\u2019s possible to do so safely.\n\nMeanwhile, homeschooling has exploded in popularity with parents setting up \u201cpod schools\u201d where several children get together in a home to get taught by a hired tutor, Butcher outlined in a recent paper. The school choice programs in several states could be used to pay for this form of education, Butcher told The Epoch Times.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nThe most substantial schools choice expansion is underway in West Virginia, where Gov. Jim Justice signed into law on March 29 the establishment of the nation\u2019s first universal education savings account program.\n\nIt means that participants will get all the education money that comes from the state budget (some $4,600 a year per pupil) deposited into a special account that can be used to pay for private schooling. Incoming kindergarteners will be automatically eligible, while children in other grades could get in after spending 45 days enrolled in a West Virginia public school.\n\nState dollars usually fund about 45 percent of education expenses. Another 45 percent comes from local budgets, typically real estate taxes, and another roughly 10 percent from the federal government, Butcher said.\n\nArizona, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi already have similar programs with differing eligibility criteria, he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nThe state is establishing a tax credit scholarship program for lower-income children. The program will be funded through private donations and the state will distribute $25 million in tax credits each year to the donors on a first-come-first-serve basis. The money is to be distributed through non-profit intermediaries to applicants based on financial need. The eligibility is set at 175 percent of income qualifying for reduced-price school meals. That\u2019s about $86,000 for a family of four (pdf).\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nThe state already runs a scholarship program funded through tax credits, though only insurance companies are eligible for the credits. It recently expanded the program to cover students already attending private schools. Children from families earning under 150 percent of the amount eligible for free and reduced-price lunch can apply (about $73,000 for a family of four).\n\nOthers\n\nGeorgia is advancing a bill that would expand its voucher program to more special needs students.\n\nFlorida is considering streamlining its five school choice programs into two, which would expand the options and eligibility for some of them.\n\nMissouri House passed a bill that would establish a tax credit scholarship program for children attending public schools, entering kindergarten, or coming from a military family. It would be initially capped at $50 million.\n\nIndiana House passed a bill that would set up education savings accounts for children with special needs, from military families, or from foster families. It would also expand eligibility for the current voucher program.\n\nNearly two dozen other states have also introduced bills that would create or expand vouchers, tax credit scholarships, or education savings accounts, according to the nonprofit Educational Freedom Institute. Only about half of those have passed at least one committee so far.\n\nOpponents of school choice have argued that such programs take students out of public schools, which then lose money that\u2019s apportioned per pupil. Public schools can\u2019t easily scale down their costs with outflow of students because part of it is fixed, such as building maintenance, debt interest, and administration. Proponents say the per-pupil part of public school funding is generally about the same as the non-fixed part of their costs so the schools should be able to cope.\n\nUpdate: The article was updated to clarify terminology referring to education savings accounts."

          "text": "Customers seated inside Corduroy Restaurant in Vancouver, British Columbia, were caught on cellphone video chanting \"Get out!\" at health inspectors who had entered the establishment to issue closure orders over COVID-19 violations, Global News reported.\n\nSoon after the chant began and quickly grew louder, the officials turned tail and left \u2014 after which cheering and applause erupted. The confrontation took place Saturday, CBC News said.\n\nVancouver By-Law - Health-Inspectors, kicked out of restaurant by supportive customers. youtu.be\n\nWhat are the details?\n\nBritish Columbia last Monday ordered a three-week ban on indoor dining to combat a third wave of the COVID-19 virus, Global News said, adding that a business can be fined $2,300 while individuals can be fined $575 for non-compliance \u2014 and there's a separate fine for belligerent behavior related to enforcement of COVID-19 orders.\n\nWith that, a liquor coordinator and provincial health officers entered Corduroy Restaurant and issued a a full closure order Saturday, Vancouver police told the outlet.\n\nAnd video apparently of that very same event showed officials \u2014 seemingly the only people wearing masks \u2014 in the restaurant laying down the law to owner Rebecca Matthews, Global News said.\n\nImage source: YouTube screenshot\n\nMatthews tells the officials \u2014 who are handing her numerous papers \u2014 that they're trespassing on private property and that she doesn't recognize their jurisdiction, the outlet added.\n\nSoon diners began their \"Get out!\" chant. Seconds later, one of the officials turned, raised his hand at a colleague as if to signal surrender, and they walked out the door.\n\nImage source: YouTube screenshot\n\nCheers and applause quickly followed.\n\nMatthews told Global News she intends to continue defying the ban since she needs the income from her business to feed her family. She added that the province is unfairly targeting restaurants while allowing other businesses to stay open, the outlet noted.\n\nMatthews added to Global News that she doesn't see a difference between indoor and outdoor dining. And during a \"save small business\" rally Friday, she questioned the reliability of COVID-19 testing and called for the end of restrictions she said were doing more harm than the virus, the outlet reported.\n\nWhat do the powers that be have to say?\n\nVancouver Coastal Health told Global News that \"any alleged violations of closure orders are taken very seriously and are thoroughly investigated.\"\n\nHealth Minister Adrian Dix added to the outlet that he's \"frustrated with the behavior [at the restaurant]. No one misunderstands the rules. We are enforcing that closure order, and it is being enforced right now, and it will be enforced.\"\n\nPublic Safety Minister Mike Farnworth on Saturday called Corduroy Restaurant's non-compliance \"disgraceful\" and said besides receiving fines businesses also can have their liquor or business licenses pulled.\n\nHere's another clip of the \"Get out!\" chant:"

          "text": "CBS News' \"60 minutes\" was blasted on Sunday by a top Democratic official in Florida and the state's largest grocery store chain after it aired a deceptively edited segment insinuating that Governor Ron DeSantis (R) engaged in a \"pay to play\" scheme with COVID-19 vaccine distribution.\n\nOn Sunday evening, CBS News' Sharyn Alfonsi reported that DeSantis received a $100,000 donation to his PAC from Publix grocery stores, which later partnered with the state to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. \"60 Minutes\" aired a clip of Alfonsi confronting DeSantis at a press conference south of Orlando, accusing the governor of \"pay to play\" by giving Publix exclusive rights to distribute the vaccine after he received that donation.\n\nThe governor said Alfonsi was \"wrong\" and spreading a \"fake narrative\" and proceeded to correct the record, but his long answer was cut out of the segment by CBS News' editors.\n\nThe Daily Wire reported the transcript of the segment, highlighting in bold the parts of DeSantis' answer that were edited out of the clip.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Publix, as you know, donated $100,000 to your campaign, and then you rewarded them with the exclusive rights to distribute the vaccination in Palm Beach\u2014\n\n\n\nRon DeSantis: So, first of all, that \u2014 what you're saying is wrong. That's\u2014\n\n\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How is that not pay-to-play?\n\n\n\nRon DeSantis: \u2014that, that's a fake narrative. So, first of all, when we did, the first pharmacies that had it were CVS and Walgreens. And they had a long-term care mission. So they were going to the long-term care facilities. They got the vaccine in the middle of December, they started going to the long-term care facilities the third week of December to do LTCs. So that was their mission. That was very important. And we trusted them to do that. As we got into January, we wanted to expand the distribution points. So yes, you had the counties, you had some drive-through sites, you had hospitals that were doing a lot, but we wanted to get it into communities more. So we reached out to other retail pharmacies \u2014 Publix, Walmart \u2014 obviously CVS and Walgreens had to finish that mission. And we said, we're going to use you as soon as you're done with that. For Publix, they were the first one to raise their hand, say they were ready to go. And you know what, we did it on a trial basis. I had three counties. I actually showed up that weekend and talked to seniors across four different Publix. How was the experience? Is this good? Should you think this is a way to go? And it was 100% positive. So we expanded it, and then folks liked it. And I can tell you, if you look at a place like Palm Beach County, they were kind of struggling at first in terms of the senior numbers. I went, I met with the county mayor. I met with the administrator. I met with all the folks in Palm Beach County, and I said, \"Here's some of the options: we can do more drive-through sites, we can give more to hospitals, we can do the Publix, we can do this.\" They calculated that 90% of their seniors live within a mile and a half of a Publix. And they said, \"We think that would be the easiest thing for our residents.\" So, we did that, and what ended up happening was, you had 65 Publix in Palm Beach. Palm Beach is one of the biggest counties, one of the most elderly counties, we've done almost 75% of the seniors in Palm Beach, and the reason is because you have the strong retail footprint. So our way has been multifaceted. It has worked. And we're also now very much expanding CVS and Walgreens, now that they've completed the long-term care mission.\n\n\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: The criticism is that it's pay-to-play, governor.\n\n\n\nRon DeSantis: And it's wrong. It's wrong. It's a fake narrative. I just disabused you of the narrative. And you don't care about the facts. Because, obviously, I laid it out for you in a way that is irrefutable.\n\n\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Well, I\u2014 I was just\u2014\n\n\n\nRon DeSantis: And, so, it's clearly not.\n\n\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Isn't there the nearest Publix \u2014\n\n\n\nRon DeSantis: No, no, no. You're wrong.\n\n\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: \u201430 miles away.\n\n\n\nRon DeSantis: You're wrong. You're wrong. Yes, sir?\n\n\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: That's actually a fact.\n\n\"The irresponsible suggestion that there was a connection between campaign contributions made to Governor DeSantis and our willingness to join other pharmacies in support of the state's vaccine distribution efforts is absolutely false and offensive,\" Publix said in a scathing statement provided to \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\n\n\"We are proud of our pharmacy associates for administering more than 1.5 million doses of vaccine to date and for joining other retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia to do our part to help our communities emerge from the pandemic,\" the grocery store said.\n\n\n\nFlorida's director of emergency management, Jared Moskowitz, the Democratic state official responsible for directing the response to the pandemic under Gov. DeSantis, came to the governor's defense and called Alfonsi's narrative \"absolute malarkey.\""

          "text": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will reportedly call for a global minimum corporate tax rate to prevent U.S. companies from relocating offshore in response to the Biden administration's forthcoming tax hikes, Axios reported on Monday.\n\nThe news outlet made clear that \"by trying to convince other countries to impose a global minimum tax, Yellen is acknowledging the risks to the American economy if it acts alone in raising corporate rates.\"\n\nThe administration has proposed initiating the largest tax hike in almost 30 years to pay for President Biden's more than $2 trillion American Jobs Act \u2014 a bill slated to fund America's \"infrastructure\" but that also finances major policy progressive policy initiatives such as climate research, green energy, and free education in addition to highways, bridges, and roads.\n\nThe tax changes include raising the country's corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a move that conservatives and moderate congressional Democrats have argued could be devastating for the American middle class.\n\nIn a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs on Monday, Yellen is expected to push for all other industrialized nations to raise their corporate tax rates to a minimum standard, as well, to ensure economic \"competitiveness\" worldwide. However, she will reportedly argue that the tax rate minimum is for the main purpose of ensuring those foreign countries have enough revenue to maintain their own governments.\n\n\"Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,\" the secretary plans to say, according to an excerpt of her prepared remarks obtained by Axios. \"It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government.\"\n\n\"We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,\" she will state.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's presidency, the business-minded Republican slashed the U.S. rate from 35% \u2014 a global high \u2014 to 21%, arguing the previous rate put American companies at a global disadvantage and resulted in many of them moving their businesses abroad.\n\nAccording to the Tax Foundation, a conservative tax group, the worldwide average corporate tax rate is just under 24%.\n\nAxios reported that Biden has tasked Yellen with convincing the business community that the massive infrastructure proposal and subsequent tax increases won't lead to inflation, a tall order by all accounts. Apparently, in the face of pressure, Yellen will look for significant international assistance."

Brian Kemp (R).\n\nIn a letter addressed to Kevin Perry, the president and CEO of the Georgia Beverage Association, eight lawmakers from the state House on Saturday accused the Coca-Cola company of spreading misinformation about Georgia elections law and caving to \"out of control cancel culture.\"\n\n\"Your company has made the conscious decision to perpetrate a national dialogue which seeks to intentionally mislead the citizens of Georgia and deepen a divide in our great State,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"We have the responsibility to all of Georgia not to engage in those misguided intentions nor continue to support corporations who choose to.\"\n\nThe letter was signed by GOP state Reps. Victor Anderson, Clint Crowe, Matt Barton, Jason Ridley, Lauren McDonald III, Stan Gunter, Dewayne Hill, and Marcus Wiedower.\n\nOn March 25, Gov. Kemp signed a sweeping election reform bill into law that would require absentee ballots to be verified with a photo ID and expand early voting for primary and general elections, among other changes. Democrats including President Joe Biden and failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams have claimed the new law will make it harder for people to vote, particularly minorities and working-class Georgians. Biden falsely claimed that the new law \"ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote after their shift is over,\" a claim refuted by experts who note the law does not change Election Day voting hours and actually expands opportunities to vote early.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have also faced backlash over the law from several corporations, including Coca-Cola, and prominently the Major League Baseball Association, which pulled its All-Star Game out of the state because of the new law.\n\nLast week, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincy told CNBC the law was \"unacceptable.\" He released a statement on behalf of the Coca-Cola Company \"to be crystal clear and state unambiguously that we are disappointed in the outcome of the Georgia voting legislation.\"\n\nQuincy asserted that some measures of the bill \"would diminish or deter access to voting.\"\n\n\"Given Coke's choice to cave to the pressure of an out of control cancel culture, we respectfully request all Coca-Cola Company products be removed from our office suite immediately.\" the lawmakers wrote in response. \"Should Coke chose to read the bill, share its true intentions and accept their role in the dissemination of mistruths, we would welcome a conversation to rebuild a working relationship.\"\n\n"

For a second year, most will be apart from their families, friends, the full congregations that fill us with joy.\"\n\nHe added, \"And yet as the Gospel of John reminds us, the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\"\n\nJill added, \"The traditions of Holy Week take us on a journey from sorrow to salvation, reminding us that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible.\"\n\nWhat else?\n\nBack in January, Pope Francis suggested that people have a \"moral obligation\" to be vaccinated.\n\n\"I believe that morally everyone must take the vaccine,\" he said. \"It is the moral choice because it is about your life but also the lives of others.\"\n\nHe added, \"I do not understand why some say that this could be a dangerous vaccine. If the doctors are presenting this to you as a thing that will go well and doesn't have any special dangers, why not take it? ... There is a suicidal denialism that I would not know how to explain, but today people must take the vaccine.\""

          "title": "Justice Thomas Drops The Hammer on Big Tech In Epic Defense For Conservatives in America",
          "text": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas unleashed on Big Tech on Monday in an epic defense for conservatives across America. Thomas argued that Facebook and Twitter may not be able to use the First Amendment as an excuse to censor people on their platforms.\n\n\u201cEven if digital platforms are not close enough to common carriers, legislatures might still be able to treat digital platforms like places of public accommodation. Although definitions between jurisdictions vary, a company ordinarily is a place of public accommodation if it provides \u2018lodging, food, entertainment, or other services to the public \u2026 in general,\u2019\u201d Thomas said, also noting that \u201cTwitter and other digital platforms bear resemblance to that definition.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, a doctrine, such as public accommodation, that reduces the power of a platform to unilaterally remove a government account might strengthen the argument that an account is truly government controlled and creates a public forum,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe similarities between some digital platforms and common carriers or places of public accommodation may give legislators strong arguments for similarly regulating digital platforms. \u2018[I]t stands to reason that if Congress may demand that telephone companies operate as common carriers, it can ask the same of\u2019 digital platforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is especially true because the space constraints on digital platforms are practically nonexistent (unlike on cable companies), so a regulation restricting a digital platform\u2019s right to exclude might not appreciably impede the platform from speaking,\u201d Thomas continued.\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cNone of this analysis means, however, that the First Amendment is irrelevant until a legislature imposes common carrier or public accommodation restrictions \u2014 only that the principal means for regulating digital platforms is through those methods,\u201d which could be interpreted as a pre-emptive endorsement of Congress if they choose to impose common carrier or public accommodation restrictions to social media platforms.\n\n***BRAND NEW Trump 2024 Hat Is Your FREE \u2013 Just Cover Shipping!***\n\nLater on during his statement, Thomas referred to the issue of Section 230.\n\n\u201cThreats directed at digital platforms can be especially problematic in the light of [Section 230], which some courts have misconstrued to give digital platforms immunity for bad-faith removal of third-party content,\u201d he said. \u201cThis immunity eliminates the biggest deterrent \u2014 a private lawsuit \u2014 against caving to an unconstitutional government threat.\n\n\u201cThe Second Circuit feared that then-President Trump cut off speech by using the features that Twitter made available to him. But if the aim is to ensure that speech is not smothered, then the more glaring concern must perforce be the dominant digital platforms themselves. As Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms. The extent to which that power matters for purposes of the First Amendment and the extent to which that power could lawfully be modified raise interesting and important questions. This petition, unfortunately, affords us no opportunity to confront them,\u201d Thomas finished.\n\n***Help Us Take Down The Liberal Media With Our FREE News App!***\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

          "text": "On Sunday night, \u201960 Minutes\u2019 rolled out a selectively edited hit job on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. It was driven by a politically biased agenda to take down a rising star in the Republican Party who many believe may have presidential ambitions in the future.\n\nThe relative success of the State of Florida in responding to a pandemic that threatens its sizable elderly population, while maintaining a reasonable degree of public freedom and respect for citizens\u2019 rights, has been a constant thorn in the side to Democrats who have been long on fear and short on facts addressing the COVID risks.\n\nThe supposed controversy turns on whether or not Florida Governor Ron DeSantis gave a favorable vaccine contract to Publix, Florida\u2019s most widely available grocery store, to assist with the vaccine rollout in exchange for a $100,000 contribution to a PAC.\n\nThe \u201cpay-to-play\u201d scandal allegation surfaced last month after Sharyn Alfonsi lobbed accusations at Governor DeSantis at a press conference. The \u201c60 Minutes\u201d episode on Sunday dropped context that would have done much to give the audience the impression that there is \u2018no story there.\u2019\n\nThe segment was so one-sided and unfair, not just to the governor but to Florida\u2019s entire representative government, that the blowback against the one-time respectable investigative news show has been furious. It is illustrative to merely give the observations of skilled media observers below.\n\nThe 60 Minutes\u2019 attempt at a hit piece on @GovRonDeSantis spoke more to how much they fear him rather than anything else. \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) April 5, 2021\n\nThe director of Florida\u2019s division of emergency management, a former 3-term Democratic state legislator, responding to @60Minutes\u2019 report tonight suggesting the DeSantis admin gave Publix preferable treatment based on their donations to DeSantis\u2019 PAC https://t.co/RPhAzEM7BP \u2014 Grace Panetta (@grace_panetta) April 5, 2021\n\nThe full unedited video shows that 60 Minutes cut out everything in bold from DeSantis in the transcript below. Pretty wild.https://t.co/7JtTrd69ikhttps://t.co/D2m7IpyD0Uhttps://t.co/ctTwTEcJoTpic.twitter.com/MMOg987nJp \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) April 5, 2021\n\nI analyze \u201c60 Minutes\u201d DeSantis vaccine conspiracy theories about the REAL reasons he prioritized the most COVID-vulnerable group and utilized state\u2019s most popular grocery store to successfully distribute. And why CBS hid facts that countered their theory. https://t.co/rXr8LvBtH7 \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) April 5, 2021\n\nAlong with the revelations that shot giant holes in CBS\u2019s narrative, were allegations about the real reason that the network ran the misleading story.\n\nThe media is DESPERATE to go after @GovRonDeSantis for any tiny thing they can because they know his leadership has been the best in 2020/2021 and it terrifies them to see a Republican who has very little on him that they can criticize running circles around Dems. https://t.co/uvNC3GzWsg \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) April 5, 2021\n\nThey\u2019re going after @GovRonDeSantis for one reason. Right now he\u2019s the biggest threat to the Marxist Democrats\u2019 control sham. \u2014 John Cardillo (@johncardillo) April 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.@60Minutes had a chance to cover the New York nursing home scandal, and they instead chose to shotgun any DeSantis narrative they could, hoping something would stick. What a metaphor for the coverage capabilities of our pathetic, partisan media. \u2014 Erielle Davidson (@politicalelle) April 5, 2021\n\n60 minutes going after @GovRonDeSantis who is by far the best Governor in America. Has @60Minutes minutes done an expose on Gov. Cuomo\u2019s hand in killing 11 thousands seniors & his multiple sexual assault allegations? \u2014 Melissa Tate (@TheRightMelissa) April 5, 2021\n\nLies the media have promulgated about DeSantis because they fear his 2024 candidacy:\n\n1. His willingness to allow local officials to open beaches, etc., would lead to massive death (lie);\n\n2. He artificially deflated death statistics (lie); \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) April 5, 2021\n\nThe parting shot.\n\nThe media is going to will a President DeSantis into existence. \u2014 Stephen L.

The governor has also called on the Republican-led Legislature to push forth a measure addressing \u2018vaccine passports.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not supporting doing any vaccine passports in the state of Florida,\u201d DeSantis said earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want the fox to guard the henhouse?\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI mean, give me a break.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is something that has huge privacy implications,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is not necessary to do. You know, we\u2019re going to have hit 3.5 million seniors that have gotten shots sometime this week. Likely 75% of seniors. It\u2019s important to be able to do it. But at the same time, we are not going to have you provide proof of this just to be able to live your life normally.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I am going to be taking some action, in the executive function, emergency function here, very shortly,\u201d the governor added.\n\nThe Washington Post earlier reported that the Biden administration was looking into a \u201cCOVID passport.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration and private companies are working to develop a standard way of handling credentials \u2014 often referred to as \u2018vaccine passports\u2019 \u2014 that would allow Americans to prove they have been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus as businesses try to reopen,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cThe effort has gained momentum amid President Biden\u2019s pledge that the nation will start to regain normalcy this summer and with a growing number of companies \u2014 from cruise lines to sports teams \u2014 saying they will require proof of vaccination before opening their doors again,\u201d the report continued.\n\nNew York has already launched its COVID passport, following a trial run on thousands of New Yorkers testing the program. The Excelsior Passport was reported to be \u201cthe first of its kind to be rolled out in United States and allows specific sites that administer COVID vaccines or test for the coronavirus to upload the data to the app,\u201d the Gothamist reported.\n\nIt is encouraging to see a few state governors \u201cget it.\u201d Now, we need to see more governors in America actually take action against this dangerous infringement on civil liberties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen on Becker News.

          "text": "The Supreme Court has ruled on a case on Monday related to former President Donald Trump\u2019s use of his Twitter account. Specifically, the case dealt with whether or not he was allowed to block users who were repeatedly criticizing him.\n\nTwitter users filed the case Knight First Amendment Institute v. Trump in 2017 and argued that the former president had violated their First Amendment rights by blocking their user accounts. While Trump tweeted from his personal account, the Twitter users argued that he had used it in a presidential capacity by releasing official statements, thus making it a \u201cpublic forum.\u201d In 2018, a judge in New York ruled that the president\u2019s actions were unconstitutional.\n\nSCOTUS sent the case back to a federal appeals court and dismissed it as moot. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion stating that dismissing the case was the right thing to do, noting that Donald Trump is no longer in office.\n\nMore importantly, Justice Thomas shared his view that digital and social media platforms now wield dangerous amounts of concentrated political power that will have to be addressed by the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s digital platforms provide avenues for historically unprecedented amounts of speech, including speech by government actors,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cAlso unprecedented, however, is the concentrated control of so much speech in the hands of a few private parties. We will soon have no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply to highly concentrated, privately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cApplying old doctrines to new digital platforms is rarely straightforward,\u201d Thomas added. \u201cRespondents have a point, for example, that some aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s account resemble a constitutionally protected public forum. But it seems rather odd to say that something is a government forum when a private company has unrestricted authority to do away with it.\u201d\n\nJustice Thomas remarks clearly that he does not believe digital platforms have First Amendment rights. This is a warning shot to Big Tech companies like Twitter.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first or only case to raise issues about digital platforms,\u201d Thomas comments. \u201cWhile this case involves a suit against a public official, the Court properly rejects today a separate petition alleging that digital platforms, not individuals on those platforms, violated public accommodations laws, the First Amendment, and antitrust laws.\u201d\n\nThomas\u2019s opinion hints that he views these Big Tech giants as having too much power for the public good. Now, the right legislation and lawsuits need to be filed to put an end to their abuse of power.\n\nAs seen on Becker News. Follow Kyle Becker and Becker News on Twitter."

          "title": "Why Being \u2018Anti-Media\u2019 Is Now Part Of The GOP Identity",
          "text": "There\u2019s little question that the media is one of the least trusted institutions in Republican circles.\n\nIn the past two decades, trust in traditional media has plummeted \u2014 especially among Republicans. According to polling from Gallup, since at least the late 1990s, Republicans have been less likely than Democrats (and independents) to say they trust the media. But starting in 2015, trust among Republicans took a nosedive, falling from 32 percent to 10 percent in 2020. (Meanwhile, among Democrats, trust in the media has actually climbed back up, and by quite a bit.)\n\nPart of this is because Republicans are often more vocal in their criticism of the media and have long perceived it as having a liberal bias. But now they are also more likely to say that being \u201canti-media\u201d is part of their political identity, and this is likely driving the staggering gap in media trust that we are seeing.\n\nrelated: How \u2018Cancel Culture\u2019 Became An Issue For Young Republicans Read more. \u00bb\n\nLet\u2019s start with Republicans\u2019 media habits. In our fractured media ecosystem, it\u2019s not uncommon for both Republicans and Democrats to seek out news sources that reinforce their political beliefs. And as a new study finds, exposure to media that is partisan \u2014 whether liberal or conservative \u2014 reduces people\u2019s overall trust in the mainstream press regardless of political party. But what sets Republicans apart at this point is their steady reliance on just one source for all their news: Fox News.\n\nElections to watch in 2021| FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast\n\nIn its study of the media landscape in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election cycle, the Pew Research Center found that of the 30 news sources it asked about, only Fox News was trusted by a majority of Republicans. (Republicans\u2019 second-most-trusted source, ABC News, wasn\u2019t even a close second: 33 percent said they trusted ABC News for political and election news compared with 65 percent who trusted Fox News.) This finding stands in stark contrast with the views of Democrats, who said they trusted a variety of news sources, and it marks a further decline in Republicans\u2019 trust of other news sources since Pew last conducted a similar survey in 2014.\n\nThis is in part because animosity toward the other party is at an all-time high and Republicans increasingly associate the news media with the Democratic Party. That means they are more likely to dismiss a source that isn\u2019t Fox News (or One America News Network or Newsmax) as politically biased. For example, in a January YouGov/American Enterprise Institute poll among people who said they voted for then-President Trump in 2020, a staggering 92 percent strongly or somewhat agreed that \u201cthe mainstream media today is just a part of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThis distrust, and Republicans\u2019 growing animosity toward the media, is significant because they\u2019re already isolated news consumers. And studies have shown that when news consumers exist in a media bubble, they can be hostile toward news that doesn\u2019t match their political beliefs. (It also means they can be too trusting of their preferred news outlets.) Plus, as Jonathan Ladd, a Georgetown University public policy and government professor and the author of \u201cWhy Americans Hate the Media and How It Matters,\u201d points out, Republicans are getting the message from Fox News (and the broader conservative media ecosystem) that the mainstream media can\u2019t be trusted. \u201cThis isn\u2019t new,\u201d Ladd said, but he added that the conservative media\u2019s continued criticism of the press has been \u201ckicked into high gear\u201d by the modern Republican Party.\n\nTake what happened in the Trump era. During both his campaign for the presidency and his four years in office, Trump openly attacked the media, calling journalists or news organizations critical of him or his administration \u201cfake news.\u201d Consequently, his supporters\u2019 existing perceptions of media bias and distrust of news organizations intensified \u2014 this was especially true among his white supporters, who are more likely to consume exclusively conservative media. For instance, at many of Trump\u2019s campaign events, his supporters would disparage, attack and threaten the press. And now, when Trump\u2019s supporters disagree with a fact, they can decry it as \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 whether it be crowd size or election results.\n\nrelated: Why Attacking \u2018Cancel Culture\u2019 And \u2018Woke\u2019 People Is Becoming The GOP\u2019s New Political Strategy Read more. \u00bb\n\nHostility and distrust of the news media, in other words, has become a point of political identity among Republicans. We see this especially in how people talk about politics online. Take, for instance, a recent study of tweets mentioning \u201cfake news.\u201d Over the course of 15 months, study authors Jianing Li and Min-Hsin Su of the University of Wisconsin-Madison found an uptick in the number of tweets that used the words \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d or \u201ctheir\u201d in conjunction with the phrase \u201cfake news.\u201d Essentially, the researchers concluded that online discussions about \u201cfake news\u201d were a way for conservatives to create a sense of group belonging (\u201cThis is the worst kind of fake news possible. We have to stop this sort of thing\u201d) while also establishing a shared enemy (\u201cFake News Media is a Hate Group. They hate President Trump\u201d). The use of pronouns that signify group belonging (like \u201cwe\u201d) and group opposition (like \u201cthey\u201d) are useful on social media platforms, like Twitter, where users interact with strangers. Even though users might not know one another personally, they are still attempting to cultivate a community, which is certainly true of users who tweet about politics.\n\nAnother study that looked at trust in news media, by University of California, Berkeley, political scientists Taeku Lee and Christian Hosam, found that this attitude, independent of partisanship, helped predict a number of political opinions, such as support for a pathway to citizenship and affirmative action. But arguably, what was more consequential is that over time (from 2016 to 2019), the role of media distrust in opinion formation shifted such that individuals who distrust the media more consistently consolidated around Trump. Essentially, that media distrust now operates \u201cas a basis for Americans to sort themselves into political tribes,\u201d according to Lee. And as their study suggests, \u201cfake news\u201d functions as a \u201cshibboleth,\u201d or a way for Trump supporters to distinguish themselves, ideologically, even from other Republicans. It is possible that \u201ca new form of conservatism is likely brewing with media distrust being one of its biggest factors,\u201d Hosam told me.\n\nSo, why is being anti-media so central to the Republican identity? It\u2019s not a coincidence that, against a backdrop of growing partisan animosity, Republicans\u2019 distrust of the media is increasing as they grow more suspect that it leans Democratic. But it\u2019s more than that, too. As Hosam explains, \u201cwhat Trump does is connect that type of opposition to the media into a form of conservatism that just wasn\u2019t around before.\u201d And one byproduct of that is that media distrust is more central to conservatives\u2019 group identity than it was before Trump. Or, as Lee put it, signaling media distrust is \u201cmuch the same as wearing a red MAGA cap.\u201d\n\nAs a researcher, Hosam admits that this can make studying distrust of the media a complicated topic, since distrust has shifted from an attitude about the institution itself to a credential of conservatism. \u201cNow it\u2019s even more difficult to know what people are really getting at when they talk about the media \u2026 what media diets and trust in the media are truly telling us.\u201d And for many Republicans, that might mean distrust of the media is better thought of as a way to understand the centrality of their partisanship to their identity.\n\nThe new voting restrictions many states are considering\n\nPolice misconduct trials are rare.

          "title": "Americans Oppose Many Voting Restrictions \u2014 But Not Voter ID Laws",
          "text": "Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nLast week, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping package of voting restrictions into law in Georgia. The new regulations \u2014 including a ban on giving food and water to voters in line and an ID requirement for absentee voting \u2014 drew harsh condemnation from Democrats, voting-rights advocates and corporations for making voting more arduous, particularly for Black voters who will be disproportionately affected. And alarmingly, the laws appear to be inspired by a baseless belief in rampant voter fraud in the 2020 election and designed to make it easier for Republicans to win elections in the future.\n\nThe new voting restrictions many states are considering\n\nBut how many Americans buy into the Republican argument that more \u201celection security\u201d is needed, and how many believe that these laws are undemocratic? On the surface, at least, they are closely divided on the issue of voting access. According to a YouGov/The Economist poll from March 20-23, Americans narrowly oppose \u201claws that would make it more difficult to vote,\u201d 44 percent to 39 percent. But of course, that\u2019s an extremely broad categorization that covers everything from laws cleaning up the voter rolls to those outright banning no-excuse absentee voting and slashing polling places. Reality is more nuanced: Americans are fine with some voting restrictions but balk at others.\n\nrelated: The States Where Efforts To Restrict Voting Are Escalating Read more. \u00bb\n\nFor instance, public opinion is strongly against perhaps the most controversial provision of Georgia\u2019s new law: the prohibition on giving food or water to people waiting in line to vote. In a different, March 29 poll, YouGov found that only 18 percent of Americans thought handing out food and water should be illegal, while 69 percent thought it should be allowed.\n\nLikewise, in the most recent YouGov/The Economist poll (conducted March 27-30), only 33 percent of Americans agreed with the part of Georgia\u2019s new law that makes ballot drop boxes only accessible during early-voting hours. By contrast, 44 percent thought drop boxes should be open at all times. Drop boxes were also popular within Georgia itself. Back in January, a University of Georgia/Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that Georgia registered voters opposed banning them 59 percent to 37 percent. While the new law didn\u2019t go that far, it did make them a lot less useful by mandating that they be located inside early-voting centers.\n\nOn the other hand, the public strongly supports one of the other major stipulations of Georgia\u2019s new law: the ID requirement for absentee voting. That latest YouGov/The Economist poll found that Americans support requiring a photo ID in order to vote absentee, 53 percent to 28 percent. And Georgians are even more supportive: 74 percent of registered voters in the UGA/AJC poll backed requiring voters to include a copy of their photo ID or other documentation in order to vote by mail. Only 22 percent were opposed.\n\nIndeed, voter ID laws \u2014 which Republicans have pushed for years \u2014 are quite popular in general. In another national poll out this week from Selzer & Co./Grinnell College, 56 percent of adults favored keeping laws that require people to show a photo ID before voting, while just 36 percent wanted to eliminate them. And this isn\u2019t an opinion Americans suddenly adopted amid 2020\u2019s specious claims of voter fraud. In fall 2018, the Pew Research Center found that 76 percent of Americans favored requiring everyone to show a government-issued photo ID in order to vote, versus only 23 percent who opposed it.\n\nOne voting restriction that Georgia did not end up enacting was requiring voters to have an excuse in order to vote absentee. Politically, it seems to have been a wise choice to kill that: According to the UGA/AJC poll, Georgians opposed the proposal 55 percent to 43 percent. Nationally, YouGov/The Economist found a nation divided over whether anyone should be able to vote by mail (44 percent) or only people who are unable to vote in person (42 percent), but that poll is an outlier. Selzer/Grinnell found that Americans favor keeping laws that allow mail voting 56 percent to 34 percent, and Pew last year found that 65 percent of the country believed that voters should not need a documented reason to be allowed to vote early or absentee. That wasn\u2019t just because of the pandemic, either: In Pew\u2019s 2018 poll, that number was 71 percent.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a reason why \u2026 (GOP has) tried to make it harder for people to vote\u2019: Silver\n\nThat said, Georgia\u2019s new law does prevent election officials from actively encouraging absentee voting by prohibiting mailing absentee-ballot applications to voters who don\u2019t request them \u2014 something the secretary of state did in last year\u2019s primary in order to encourage mail voting amid the pandemic. According to the UGA/AJC poll, Georgia seems to be split right down the middle on this prohibition: 49 percent are against it and 47 percent are for it. But the public is more firmly against more aggressive promotions of absentee voting, at least on the national level. For example, respondents to the YouGov/The Economist poll opposed mailing absentee ballots to all registered voters (which nine states and Washington, D.C., did in 2020), 59 percent to 24 percent. And per Pew, back in 2018, Americans opposed conducting all elections by mail, 65 percent to 34 percent.\n\nGeorgia is hardly the only state where legislators are considering changing voting laws \u2014 either to make them stricter or, in many cases, more accessible. But the complicated public opinion on voting issues just goes to show that not all voting reforms are viewed the same way \u2014 and neither party should assume the public is fully on their side.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nWashington\u2019s consternation over potentially abolishing the Senate filibuster doesn\u2019t appear to be shared by the American people. According to a YouGov/Yahoo News poll, 36 percent of adults support ending the filibuster, while only 27 percent oppose it. A whopping 37 percent are unsure. That may be because only 34 percent of adults say they know \u201ca lot\u201d about how the filibuster works; 40 percent say they\u2019ve heard of the filibuster but don\u2019t know how it works, while 26 percent say they know \u201cnothing\u201d about the filibuster.\n\nFor the first time in more than 80 years of Gallup polling, fewer than half of Americans say they are a member of a church, synagogue or mosque: 47 percent, down from 70 percent as recently as 1999. The drop is driven by generational change: While 66 percent of those born before 1946 are still members of a house of worship, only 36 percent of millennials (born 1981-1996) are. That\u2019s roughly the same as the share of millennials with no religious affiliation (31 percent).\n\nIt\u2019s not news that Americans are frustrated with government, but it\u2019s still sobering to see it quantified. According to the Pew Research Center, 53 percent of Americans are \u201cnot too\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d satisfied with the way democracy is working in the U.S. (only 45 percent of Americans are at least somewhat satisfied with it). In addition, 67 percent of Americans think the phrase \u201cmost politicians are corrupt\u201d describes their country well. Both numbers are higher in the U.S. than in the three other countries Pew surveyed: the United Kingdom, France and Germany.\n\nThursday was the first day of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, which will look pretty different from past seasons thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. To the approval of 62 percent of MLB fans (per a recent Ipsos poll), every team except the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros will open stadiums to less than half capacity to start the season. But MLB will not mandate proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test in order to attend a game, despite 67 percent of fans supporting such a requirement.\n\nThursday was also April Fool\u2019s Day, a day that this year saw Bud Light \u201cintroduce\u201d a pizza-flavored seltzer and the Chicago Bears \u201ctrade for\u201d a star quarterback. Probably only about half of Americans appreciated these gags, though: According to YouGov, only 45 percent of adults think April Fool\u2019s Day pranks are generally funny, while 47 percent are no fun and think they\u2019re mostly just annoying.\n\nBiden approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 54.0 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 39.6 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +14.4 points). At this time last week, 54.3 percent approved and 39.9 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +14.4 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 53.9 percent and a disapproval rating of 37.1 percent, for a net approval rating of +16.8 points.\n\nElections to watch in 2021| FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast\n\nWhat are pollster ratings? | Polling 101 from FiveThirtyEight"

          "text": "Even before the coronavirus became a worldwide pandemic, some astute observers of racial and ethnic politics feared that the emerging outbreak in China would lead to (and were already contributing to) a rise in anti-Asian sentiment in America. After all, the United States has a long and ugly history of scapegoating racial and ethnic groups for diseases in ways that are used to justify xenophobia.\n\nSadly, it didn\u2019t take long for those fears to be realized. Racist harassment online, verbal attacks in public and physical assaults against Asian Americans all surged in the early days of the pandemic and have remained alarmingly high ever since. In fact, anti-Asian hate crimes in the U.S. increased by nearly 150 percent from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHow the Atlanta attacks may activate Asian Americans politically\n\nBut it took the murder of six Atlanta women of Asian descent in March for many to finally realize the seriousness of the problem. According to Google Trends data, Google searches like \u201cAsian Americans\u201d and \u201cviolence against Asian Americans\u201d skyrocketed after the shooting. Similarly, the share of respondents in last week\u2019s YouGov/Economist poll who said there is \u201ca great deal\u201d of discrimination against Asian people (33 percent) doubled since YouGov asked this question in March 2020 after reports of COVID-19-related backlash against Asian Americans had initially surfaced.\n\nRelated: The U.S. Has A Long-Standing History Of Vilifying Minority Groups During Times Of Crisis Read more. \u00bb\n\nOf course, as the targets of this hatred, Asian Americans have been much more aware of the growing problem. In a June 2020 Pew Research Center poll, 58 percent of Asian Americans said it was more common for people to express racist or racially insensitive views about people who are Asian than it was before the coronavirus outbreak, compared to just 39 percent of all adults. And about half of those surveyed in AAPI Data\u2019s 2020 Asian American Voter Survey also said they worried \u201cvery often\u201d or \u201csomewhat often\u201d about experiencing hate crimes, harassment and discrimination because of COVID-19.\n\nThe effect of this hatred has partisan ramifications, too. Asian Americans\u2019 escalating fears of discrimination and harassment during the pandemic will likely solidify their already strong support of Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s true for a couple of reasons. First, perceptions of discrimination and feelings of social exclusion are strongly linked with how Asian Americans vote. Take, for example, the relationship between Asian Americans who said they perceived discrimination and how they said they would vote in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOver three-quarters of Asian American and Pacific Islanders voters who thought there was \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of anti-Asian discrimination in the U.S. supported Joe Biden over Donald Trump in weekly Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape surveys conducted from April to September 2020. But only 37 percent of Asian Americans who didn\u2019t think there was any anti-Asian discrimination preferred Biden to Trump in the presidential election.\n\nPolitical scientists Alexander Kuo, Neil Malhotra and Cecilia Mo have argued that Asian Americans who experience discrimination are more likely to support Democrats because they associate social exclusion based on their ethnic background with the predominantly white Republican Party. Take, for example, what Kuo, Malhotra and Mo found in one experiment. Some participants were randomly subjected to a microaggression from a white lab assistant who questioned their citizenship before having them answer a survey that measured political attitudes. The Asian Americans subjected to the microaggression were 13 percentage points more likely than the control group to view the Democratic Party in a positive light.\n\nThis uptick came at the expense, too, of how respondents thought about the Republican Party. That is, the Asian Americans who were subjected to the microaggression were more likely to say that Republicans were close-minded and associate the party with exclusionary treatment. That is something that has been made much more explicit during the pandemic.\n\nrelated: Women Of Color Were Shut Out Of Congress For Decades. Now They\u2019re Transforming It. Read more. \u00bb\n\nDemocratic politicians, for instance, have consistently shown far greater concern than their Republican counterparts over the rise in hate directed against Asian Americans during the pandemic\u2014 differences that were clearly on display in the 2020 presidential campaign. Then-candidate Joe Biden forcefully condemned President Trump\u2019s repeated use of terms like \u201cChinese virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d to describe the coronavirus, warning that such language could endanger Asian Americans.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence to support those concerns, too. Two recent studies found that online animosity and offline hate incidents against Asian Americans heightened after Trump linked China and COVID-19 in his tweets; another study found that Trump\u2019s framing of the pandemic as China\u2019s fault increased anti-Asian sentiments and xenophobia in survey experiments; and there\u2019s evidence, too, that rank-and-file Republicans have become much more hostile toward China during the pandemic \u2014 views that experts warn pose a threat to all Asian Americans.\n\nIn total, the prejudice Asian Americans have experienced during the pandemic does seem to have further solidified their already strong support of the Democratic Party. Analyzing data from weekly Nationscape surveys conducted between July 2019 and May 2020, political scientists Nathan Chan, Jae Yeon Kim and Vivien Leung show that Asian Americans moved more toward the Democratic Party than other racial and ethnic groups after Trump first made ethnically inflammatory remarks about the coronavirus. Chan and his colleagues concluded from their findings that exclusionary rhetoric from partisan elites \u201cfurther cement[s] Asian Americans as Democrats.\u201d\n\nThis certainly doesn\u2019t mean that social exclusion and experiences with discrimination are the only reasons why Asian Americans have overwhelmingly supported Democrats. Nor is it possible to precisely predict how the rise in anti-Asian hate during the pandemic will affect Asian American partisanship in the long run. But, at the very least, Republican rhetoric about the pandemic and the rise in anti-Asian hate over the past year seems to have solidified the longstanding link between Asian Americans\u2019 feelings of social exclusion and their support for the Democratic Party.\n\nPolice misconduct trials are rare.

He\u2019s nervous:\n\nIn other words, Clarence Thomas is inviting Congress to ban social media companies from engaging in content moderation by stripping them of their own First Amendment rights and transforming them, for legal purposes, into common carriers or public accommodations. You know the conservatives who have been arguing\u2014unsuccessfully so far\u2014that social media companies are so powerful that Congress can essentially override their own First Amendment rights and force them to host certain speech on their platforms? Thomas just endorsed that argument. !!! Thomas cites arguments that Section 230, which provides immunity to platforms for third-party content, *violates the First Amendment.* Legal scholars often talk about how fringe constitutional arguments go from \u201coff the wall\u201d to \u201con the wall.\u201d Clarence Thomas just took a huge step toward moving arguments against social media companies\u2019 right to engage in content modification \u201con the wall\u201d\u2014into the mainstream. I am confident that Clarence Thomas\u2019 rallying cry for legislation overriding social media companies\u2019 First Amendment rights and forcing them to host speech is *entirely* about right-wing fears that Twitter, Facebook, etc. are censoring conservative speech In other news, Gorsuch, joined by Alito, wants to expand employers\u2019 obligation to grant religious accommodations to workers under Title VII. Kavanaugh and Thomas have suggested they support this move, as well. Back to Thomas: His position appears to be that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend an unlimited amount of money influencing elections\u2014free of disclosure requirements\u2014but no First Amendment right to disassociate with speech they do not like.

          "text": "Control over state colleges and universities is in the hands of their boards of trustees. Their duties are not to get involved in the minutiae of operations, but to keep disastrous decisions by administrators at bay.\n\nIt\u2019s not working. Boards seldom lift a finger in opposition to administration policies, especially if doing so would mean an unpleasant battle against politically zealous administrators, faculty, students, and the media. Most trustees just don\u2019t want to bother.\n\nIn today\u2019s Martin Center article, Jay Schalin looks at the way boards in the UNC system have reacted to the invasion of DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) programs and policies in UNC institutions.\n\nHe writes, \u201cImplementing the DEI agenda enfranchises a collectivist, racialized political theory that goes against almost everything our nation has long stood for. Consider a letter sent by the dean of the North Carolina State School of Veterinary Medicine to his school\u2019s faculty, which states:\n\nWe must commit to our Values and to being a Values-Driven culture. We must support the cause of Black Lives Matter with more than just words, this is the time to commit to anti-racism and to demonstrate that commitment through action.\u201d\n\nDEI ideology has been sweeping through UNC institutions (and much of the rest of higher education in America) for the last year. Have the boards done anything to stop or even slow it?\n\nNo, but why not?\n\nSchalin: \u201cThat reluctance to look out for the interests of the majority of North Carolinians raises some very basic questions. Why are the boards not up in arms when a disturbing political litmus test is imposed on the institutions they are sworn to defend? What human incentives are behind their inactivity: confusion, ignorance, cowardice, or corruption?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s probably some of each. Whatever the reason, the UNC system is embracing a divisive and destructive ideology that can only damage the education that students and taxpayers are paying for."

          "text": "Senator Joe Manchin has rejected President Biden\u2019s proposal to hike the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, which is a key way that the administration wants to raise money to partially offset the new infrastructure bill.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that Manchin has recently indicated he was broadly supportive of a large infrastructure package and would be open to raising the corporate income tax from 21 percent to \u201cat least 25 percent.\u201d And Manchin has even floated a value-added tax, which would incidentally be regressive, as consumption-based taxes tend to hurt lower-income individuals who spend a higher percentage of what they earn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo it isn\u2019t clear that Manchin has any hard principle at stake on taxes that would be a dealbreaker for Biden\u2019s spending proposals. I mean, why be open to \u201cat least 25 percent\u201d but find 28 percent over the top? It seems as if he just wants to be seen as somehow less liberal than the median Democrat, even while voting with Democrats on most major issues when push comes to shove."

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has just vindicated President Trump in the ridiculous case from Democrats over him blocking critics on Twitter:\n\nCNBC \u2013 The Supreme Court on Monday erased a federal appeals court decision holding that former President Donald Trump violated the Constitution by blocking his critics on Twitter. The justices vacated the decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and sent it back to the lower court with instructions to dismiss the case as \u201cmoot,\u201d or no longer active, now that Trump is a private citizen. The action means the lower court\u2019s decision will no longer bind future judges. A three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit held unanimously in 2019 that Trump was acting in his official capacity when he used Twitter\u2019s block feature. By doing so, the court said, Trump was effectively excluding individuals from a public forum, in violation of the First Amendment. The announcement came in an order list and without a written explanation of the court\u2019s reasoning. There were no noted dissents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there were no dissents, there was a concurring opinion from Clarence Thomas:\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurrence that he agreed with the decision to vacate the 2nd Circuit opinion given that Trump no longer held office. Thomas said that the petition highlighted the \u201cprincipal legal difficulty that surrounds digital platforms\u2014 namely, that applying old doctrines to new digital platforms is rarely straightforward.\u201d \u201cRespondents have a point, for example, that some aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s account resemble a constitutionally protected public forum,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cBut it seems rather odd to say that something is a government forum when a private company has unrestricted authority to do away with it.\u201d\n\nAccording to some on Twitter, Thomas also suggested that social media companies are too powerful and can be regulated by Congress without violating the Constitution. This potentially spells bad news for Twitter and Facebook. You can read his full opinion here, starting on page 9. It goes for about 10 pages."

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis weekend we exposed how CBS 60 Minutes doctored an exchange between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and their reporter in order to scandalize the store Publix, a former donor to DeSantis, getting a big vaccine contract.\n\nIn that exchange, which we originally posted in full here, DeSantis explained that after querying big retail pharmacies like Publix and Walmart, that Publix was the only store ready to run with the vaccines. They then did a trial run in three counties before rolling it out to a mega county like Palm Beach County, he met with officials in the county and they chose to go with Publix because the store is everywhere and most seniors live very close to the stores.\n\nNot scandalous whatsoever. But CBS 60 Minutes still tried to scandalize it last night with their hit piece:\n\nCampaign finance reports obtained by 60 Minutes show that weeks before Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a partnership with Publix grocery stores to distribute the vaccine in its pharmacies, Publix donated $100,000 to his PAC. https://t.co/bS3ZBeET1W pic.twitter.com/BSUlpVbXSP \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) April 4, 2021\n\nAfter seeing the hit job last night Jared Moskowitz, a former 3-term Democratic state legislature who runs Florida\u2019s Division of Emergency Management, came to Desantis\u2019 defense saying that the Publix recommendation didn\u2019t come from the governor\u2019s office, but came from Florida\u2019s Health Department and his Division of Emergency Management:\n\n@60Minutes I said this before and I\u2019ll say it again. @Publix was recommended by @FLSERT and @HealthyFla as the other pharmacies were not ready to start. Period! Full Stop! No one from the Governors office suggested Publix. It\u2019s just absolute malarkey. https://t.co/obkqYcbrzt \u2014 Jared MASKowitz \ud83d\ude37 (@JaredEMoskowitz) April 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this isn\u2019t the first time Moskowitz made this statement. He also explained this in early March when the Miami Herald started pushing this nonsense, and his explanation sounds exactly like the explanation DeSantis gave a couple of weeks ago when CBS was hounding him over this fake story.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t CBS interview Moskowitz for their show? Why didn\u2019t they talk to him about it beforehand? He\u2019d clearly made his opinion on this known. Because it would have completely derailed their hit job on DeSantis. They want to hurt him because he\u2019s a rising star on the right with presidential aspirations:\n\nIf DeSantis were not perceived as a legit 2024 GOP contender for President, 60 Minutes would not be selectively editing footage to make him look bad. \u2014 Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) April 5, 2021\n\nBen Shapiro agreed:\n\nLies the media have promulgated about DeSantis because they fear his 2024 candidacy:\n\n1. His willingness to allow local officials to open beaches, etc., would lead to massive death (lie);\n\n2. He artificially deflated death statistics (lie); \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) April 5, 2021\n\n3. He boosted vaccines for rich allies (lie, he tranched them to the elderly);\n\n4. He allowed the largest grocery chain in Florida to distribute vaccines because he was bribed (lie). \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) April 5, 2021\n\nThe media are damned liars. They are not bad at their jobs. They're very good at their jobs. It's just that their job is not journalism. It's Democratic Party propaganda. \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) April 5, 2021\n\nThings normal people think because the media are damned liars:\n\n1. GA's voter law restricts voter access and is a new form of Jim Crow;\n\n2. DeSantis is both corrupt and dangerous;\n\n3. Hunter Biden is a soulful innocent gone wrong, and the laptop story was Russian disinformation. \u2014 Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) April 5, 2021"

Totally, totally fantastic.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to hear even a whisper of whining from anyone about how Christie was mean to Trump or too nice to Biden or whatever your grievance is. This is way too important and way too good. You\u2019ll watch it and you\u2019ll like it. End of discussion.\n\nBecause Christie SMASHES the lies and myths about the law. The liberal panelists KNOW it. They become FRANTIC about it.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: \u201cDrop boxes now become a permanent part of the Georgia landscape, they were not prior to Covid. They are now,\u201d he said. One of the libs pathetically tried to respond to that by saying there are not ENOUGH drop boxes.\n\nNot enough? They didn\u2019t even get rid of them? In fact they ENABLED them PERMANENTLY?? That\u2019s a preeetttttyyy long from \u201csuppression\u201d don\u2019t y\u2019all think?.\n\n\u201cMinimum of 17 days of early voting, including two Saturdays and two optional Sundays,\u201d he points out. So much for that \u201csuppressing the black voter\u201d myth about shutting down weekends.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have all voters being able to have multiple ways to prove who they are, driver\u2019s license, last four numbers of your Social Security number, even a utility bill or a free ID provided by the state of Georgia\u201d he points out. So much for \u201cAfrican-American voters won\u2019t know how to use numbers on their drivers license\u201d bigotry from the left.\n\n\u201cStacey Abrams, by the way, Stacey Abrams was in New Jersey, in my state, praising Phil Murphy this week for a voting law where New Jersey early voting is nine days. Half, half of what Georgia is. Yet she\u2019s on TV in New Jersey \u2014 I saw it myself \u2014 saying that this is one of the greatest voting expansion bills we\u2019ve ever seen, but this is Jim Crow? I\u2019m sorry, George.\u201d\n\nThat is just a KABOOM.\n\nWhen Yvette Simpson says the stupid water thing it really gets crazy.\n\n\u201cA hundred and fifty feet, where, in New Jersey, in Chicago and any place else in the country, you\u2019re not \u2014 he\u2019s saying partisan groups cannot do electioneering by giving out food and water. And in the Georgia bill says that there can be water provided by the state of Georgia, just not by partisan groups,\u201d Christie explains to the libs.\n\nSarah Isgur says it may be a dumb provision but \u201cit\u2019s not a threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nSimpson, giving the game away, says \u201cEvery time you try to restrict voting rights it\u2019s a threat to democracy.\u201d\n\nSee how they are trying to work it? Devious and evil. Isgur responds \u201cBut that\u2019s not restricting voting rights.\u201d\n\nRight. And yet the libs continue to say that it is, facts be damned.\n\nThe part where Christie just KEEPS calling Joe Biden a LIAR is also pretty great.\n\nHere\u2019s the full transcript.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Listen, it\u2019s just a symptom, George. It\u2019s a symptom of what\u2019s going on in our country right now.\n\nI mean, let\u2019s talk about what the Georgia law is really about because we haven\u2019t had much of that. Drop boxes now become a permanent part of the Georgia landscape. They were not prior to COVID. They are now.\n\nMinimum of 17 days of early voting, including two Saturdays and two optional Sundays. You\u2019re going to have all voters being able to have multiple ways to prove who they are, driver\u2019s license, last four numbers of your Social Security number, even a utility bill or a free ID provided by the state of Georgia, and voting is going to be until \u2014 from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. as it is right now in Georgia.\n\nThis is what we \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, what is this a symptom of? It sounds like you\u2019re against \u2014\n\nCHRISTIE: It\u2019s a symptom of, it\u2019s a symptom of this, George. And I hate to come in here this morning to say this because I sat here and listened to the president\u2019s inaugural address. And I just want a couple of real quick points from it.\n\nPolitics need not be a raging fire that destroys everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war, and we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated or made up.\n\nAnd Joe Biden\u2019s broken his own rule, 84 days. And now, he\u2019s lying to the American people, George. He\u2019s lying about this bill. He\u2019s lying to the American people about it to cause the raging fire he said he was going to put out. I\u2019m very disappointed.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Yvette, he did make some misstatements about the bill. The bill basically, though, restricts access to early \u2014 not to early voting but to absentee ballots, but it does expand early voting.\n\nYVETTE SIMPSON, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, it depends on how you think about it. You know, you have to pick between a Saturday or a Sunday and what we know about early voting is a lot of folks appreciate, expect and depend on that weekend voting. We know that Sundays are a time when a lot of churches do go.\n\nSo, the fact that you have to pick between the two is a challenge. It still does not address voter purging which is a big significant issue and there are not enough drop boxes, in fact. Part of the challenge was, yes, you\u2019ve solidified it, but no, you have not provided sufficient drop boxes for folks.\n\nSo, it \u2014 let\u2019s stop and back up and say, first, the motivation was not to do more. The motivation was actually to do less.\n\nWe know that voter fraud was not an issue. And so, this just the motivation enough was enough, and I don\u2019t think this goes far enough. I think that, you know, what do we need to do to make sure early voting gets expanded? Seventeen days is not enough early voting.\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, Stacey Abrams, by the way, Stacey Abrams was in New Jersey, in my state, praising Phil Murphy this week for a voting law where New Jersey early voting is nine days. Half, half of what Georgia is.\n\nYet she\u2019s on TV in New Jersey \u2014 I saw it myself \u2014 saying that this is one of the greatest voting expansion bills we\u2019ve ever seen, but this is Jim Crow? I\u2019m sorry, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: She\u2019s not \u2014 she\u2019s not for moving the all-star game.\n\nBut, Sarah, one of the interesting things we\u2019re seeing here is not just Major League Baseball. It\u2019s Delta. It\u2019s Coca-Cola. It does appear here that corporate America is out of step with the Republican base.\n\nSARAH ISGUR, ABC NEWS ANALYST: That\u2019s certainly true, but I think that Republicans have stumbled on a pretty good message here which is Delta, Coke, et cetera, these corporations coming out and condemning the Georgia bill, which, as you said, is ridiculous compared to other states. Delaware, Joe Biden\u2019s home state, didn\u2019t even have early voting in 2020. They won\u2019t have it until 2022. They\u2019re condemning that. They\u2019re condemning this Georgia bill without really understanding it. Joe Biden has been labeled a recidivist liar for what he has said about the bill by the fact checking organizations.\n\nAnd what about China? We have actual concentration camps going on in China and these corporations won\u2019t say word one about it. And the hypocrisy of that, I think, is very clear to a Republican base that this isn\u2019t about whether the feel strongly about a Georgia bill that doesn\u2019t do what the Democrats are afraid it will do and it doesn\u2019t do what the Republicans want it to do, by the way. But, at the same time, unwilling to say word one about China because that\u2019s where the money is.\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d ANCHOR: They wouldn\u2019t be doing it if it wasn\u2019t in their corporate interest.\n\nYVETTE SIMPSON, DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA CEO AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.\n\nRAHM EMANUEL, (D) FORMER MAYOR OF CHICAGO AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the \u2014 you\u2019ve got to put this in a lineage. Also, if you go back four years ago, when North Carolina changed their laws as related to bathrooms, corporations then took a \u2014 pressure in isolating North Carolina. That\u2019s also the situation here. It\u2019s a shot across the bar to every other state that\u2019s looking at changing the laws. They\u2019re trying to fix the problem that did not happen.\n\nSIMPSON: Right.\n\nEMANUEL: And one of the worst part \u2014 that is the fundamental. There was no problem and they\u2019re coming up \u2014 it\u2019s like \u2014 they\u2019re coming up with the solution to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. And it\u2019s a shot across the bow to a bunch of other states. And the worst case that this bill, which none of you have mentioned, is the fact that the state legislature wants to overrule both the secretary of states (INAUDIBLE). They\u2019re \u2014 for what \u2014 what other reason. I\u2019ll repeat what I said last week, which is, if Donald Trump would have won Georgia, there\u2019d be no change in the law. And the fact that because Joe Biden won that this is \u2014 look, it\u2019s a, you know \u2014\n\nISGUR: If Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams were saying that, I think we\u2019d have a very frank (ph) conversation.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right.\n\nEMANUEL: I have no problem fixing the \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of problems to fix. This was not a problem to fix.\n\nISGUR: But they\u2019re not. Joe Biden said, it ended early voting. It doesn\u2019t end early voting.\n\nCHRISTIE: This is \u2014 it expands early voting in Georgia. The president said it ended it.\n\nListen, he\u2019s what Joe Biden\u2019s got to live with when he wakes up this morning on Easter morning. He is doing exactly what he sat around in the campaign and the transition and accused Donald Trump of doing. He is lying to cause racial divisions in this country. That\u2019s what he accused Donald Trump of doing and he\u2019s a liar and a hypocrite this morning (ph).\n\nEMANUEL: Yes, wait \u2014 so, hold on \u2014 hold on \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Then how do you explain why Major League Baseball is making the move?\n\nCHRISTIE: It\u2019s a business judgment, George. It\u2019s a business judgement. Major League Baseball has to make a decision about what is in their best business interest. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what \u2014\n\nEMANUEL: Chris \u2014\n\nCHRISTIE: I haven\u2019t spoken to anybody there, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s what this is (ph).\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: If it \u2014 if it\u2019s in their best business interest, doesn\u2019t that suggest that there\u2019s something wrong with the law?\n\nCHRISTIE: No. What it suggests is that\u2019s the climate in this country right now. That\u2019s the climate of what it is.\n\nSIMPSON: You should ask the people who know. You should ask the people who know. I\u2019ve been doing voter protection for 10 years. Just the idea that you can\u2019t give people water in line. I know people\u2019s babies \u2014\n\nCHRISTIE: No, that\u2019s just not true.\n\nISGUR: That is (INAUDIBLE) \u2014\n\nCHRISTIE: That\u2019s not true.\n\nSIMPSON: I have held people\u2019s babies while they go in to vote in order to enfranchise the vote.

          "text": "The United States gave a grant of $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and the decision wasn\u2019t even scrutinized by the agency Dr. Anthony Fauci heads up. This per a new report from The Daily Caller which lays out in detail exactly how the transfer happened and the lack of oversight involved.\n\n(related Lawmakers Call for Investigation Into \u2018Secretive\u2019 NIH Payments to Wuhan Lab)\n\nAn oversight board created to scrutinize research that would enhance highly dangerous pathogens did not review a National Institutes of Health grant that funded a lab in Wuhan, China, to genetically modify bat-based coronaviruses. Experts say the NIH grant describes scientists conducting gain-of-function research, a risky area of study that, in this case, made SARS-like viruses even more contagious. Federal funding for gain-of-function research was temporarily suspended in 2014 due to widespread scientific concerns it risked leaking supercharged viruses into the human population.\n\nAs the report notes, this kind of research was suspended for several years due to concerns deadly viruses could leak out of these labs. Though that hasn\u2019t been conclusively shown to be what happened with COVID-19, there has been circumstantial evidence to suggest an unintentional leak from the Wuhan lab was the cause.\n\nDespite the danger involved in studying bat-coronaviruses, the grant was not scrutinized by the P3CO commission, which exists to look into whether research enhancing pathogens is safe and worth the risk.\n\nHad EcoHealth\u2019s grant been subjected to P3CO review, an HHS panel would have independently evaluated the grant and, if necessary, recommended additional biocontainment measures to prevent potential lab leaks \u2014 or even recommended that the grant be denied entirely.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to take this news. Mine is fairly simple \u2014 why are we giving money to a communist laboratory in Wuhan, China in the first place? Forget all the theories or fights over how and why COVID-19 ended up a global pandemic. It would certainly be a big coincidence that the WIV was studying and enhancing bat-based coronaviruses at the same time one makes it into the general population, but I suppose it\u2019s possible it actually came from a bat that exists in the wild hundreds of miles away\n\nRegardless, the use of federal funding in this instance should be heavily criticized. China is not our friend. Their goals are not our goals. We do not need the Chinese to study pathogens. There is no reason we should be giving them over half a million dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to do anything, much less do something as dangerous as enhancing coronaviruses.\n\nNone of this should be controversial, in my view. There needs to be a real reckoning at the appropriations level for how much money is given to foreign entities and why they are given it. Whether this grant played a direct role in creating what we now call COVID-19, we will likely never know. The Chinese aren\u2019t going to allow a real investigation. But that this isn\u2019t even a question is something that was completely preventable."

          "text": "The ironic thing about this clip is that it begins with him dumping on Ron DeSantis for prioritizing \u201cowning the libs\u201d in his policies, yet DeSantis\u2019s most celebrated decision as governor was driven by the very point Scarborough makes here. He fought to reopen Florida\u2019s schools last summer, believing it was riskier to keep kids home and do them lasting developmental damage than to bring them back and tolerate occasional small COVID outbreaks. The science has vindicated him on that risk calculation, as Morning Joe now allows.\n\nDeSantis\u2019s reward for being ahead of the curve on one of the most important policy disputes of the pandemic is the eternal grudging disdain of the Beltway class for his Trump pedigree. Oh well.\n\nStill, two cheers for Scarborough for championing this cause. Few news shows are more influential among legislators and political media influencers than his; if he\u2019s showing exasperation at the slow pace of school reopenings, that\u2019ll signal to them that it\u2019s a genuine problem rather than just a Republican talking point they might otherwise dismiss. He\u2019s not stopping at schools either:\n\nAs the risk of COVID is on the decline, the mental health crisis across America is at a breaking point. The great progress made combating COVID demands a science-based plan to reopen cities like Boston sooner rather than later. Fools may rush in, but they often act too cautious. \u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) April 5, 2021\n\nSchools remain the chief concern, though, and not just because educating kids is an unusually high social priority. Businesses will reopen as soon as their communities let them, as their bottom lines demand it. Most or all will be operating this summer. Schools are different: Thanks to the power of the teachers unions and their bizarre, selfish hypercaution about returning to class, there\u2019s still doubt about whether some school districts will reopen this fall \u2014 even though every teacher in America will have been eligible for vaccination for many months by then.\n\nConcerns of teachers, who have argued it is too dangerous to return to many buildings, probably will linger, and so may battles that consumed many districts this year. Some families are sure to prefer fully remote education \u2014 either because it is working for their children or because they fear going back. Many districts will continue to offer online options\u2026 Several district leaders said they are planning to reopen full time but they are not ready to commit. They say they cannot predict the path of the pandemic or whether their communities will do what is needed to bring and keep infection rates down. Some fear the spread of variants of the virus, against which vaccines may not be as effective, will lead to a fresh surge in cases and a new round of restrictions\u2026 \u201cI\u2019ve seen inequalities all my life, and the last thing we can afford to do at the end of a pandemic that has already disproportionately impacted our Black and Brown and Indigenous communities, the last thing we need to do is to say we did not take the time to do studies in their environments, in their schools,\u201d [NEA President Becky Pringle] said. \u201cWe still have lots of questions.\u201d\n\nIf your kid goes to a public school in a blue state and you can afford to either move or switch them to private, start thinking hard about it now. Don\u2019t gamble on your state doing right by you by September. If they cared about your children, they\u2019d already be in class, no?\n\nHaving said that, there *is* good news. The national picture has gotten much better since January:\n\nNEW: Well over 50 percent of K-12 students now have the option to attend in-person classes 5 days a week. https://t.co/Z4Co1JJGk8 pic.twitter.com/xx7mO1blBN \u2014 Jim Roberts (@nycjim) March 30, 2021\n\nMore than half of kids are in school full-time and more than 80 percent are in classrooms at least part-time. As COVID cases continue to decline this summer, more schools will shift to in-class instruction for the fall, leaving the ones that are still leaning towards virtual learning looking like extreme, embarrassing outliers by comparison. That pressure will help reopen some districts that are on the fence. It already has, in fact: Burbio\u2019s state \u201cindex\u201d for measuring how many kids are back in class finds blue states like Michigan, Connecticut, and Vermont already on par with some red ones. Kids are going back. The question now is whether some will need to wait until fall to do so or whether public pressure can get them back soon, before the end of the current school year. That\u2019s what has Scarborough exercised. With cases low in so many parts of the U.S. right now, he says, why wait?\n\nWatch four minutes here. More of this, please."

          "text": "In one of the rarer cases of President Joe Biden pushing an agenda item that he actually discussed on the campaign trail, he\u2019s preparing to roll out a bunch of tax increases that he wants the Democrats to push through congress. Chief among these is a significant increase in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. This would supposedly be an example of making employers \u201cpay their fair share\u201d and the revenue would go toward paying for Biden\u2019s massive infrastructure proposal along with the rest of his staggering tax-and-spend plans. But if he thought the plan was just going to sail through smoothly, he may have overestimated the existing support for such a measure. The Wall Street Journal reports this week that a number of House Democrats are already getting cold feet and looking for different ways to finance their ambitions. (Subscription required)\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s proposed tax increases on corporations as part of a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan have drawn a skeptical reaction from some Democrats, who instead favor borrowing money to pay for the investments or raising other levies, like the gasoline tax, to do so. The proposal would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and increase taxes on companies\u2019 foreign earnings. The White House said the tax increases would, over 15 years, cover the cost of the $2.3 trillion package, which puts money toward improving roads, bridges, and transit systems, along with expanding broadband access and myriad other efforts. Republicans have widely rejected Mr. Biden\u2019s proposed tax increases, but some Democrats are raising their own questions about the plan. With very narrow majorities in the House and Senate, Democrats will need nearly unanimous support in their party to advance the package without Republican votes, and many lawmakers are floating potential changes to the plan.\n\nNancy Pelosi is all in favor of Biden\u2019s corporate tax hike as one might expect, but she\u2019s also keenly aware that her majority margin in the House is now down to single digits. She\u2019s going to have to do quite a bit of cat-herding to push that beast over the line and there are already signs of potential Democratic defectors making noises about not going along with the plan.\n\nCongressman Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.), who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has already gone on record saying that he doesn\u2019t believe funding the infrastructure bill entirely through tax hikes is necessary. He would prefer some combination of an increase in the federal gas tax and \u201cborrowing\u201d more money to cover it. (There\u2019s that magical money tree again.) Richard Neal (D., Mass.) has similarly said that he expects to see \u201cchanges\u201d in the tax hikes made by the House.\n\nJosh Gottheimer (D., N.J.) is quoted as saying that he doesn\u2019t want to see a bill of this size forced through without at least some GOP support. He\u2019s suggesting that his party look for \u201calternatives to the corporate tax increase\u201d in order to bring some Republicans along. He and some other northeastern Democrats are suggesting that a new \u201cmileage tax\u201d paid by drivers of electric vehicles should be on the table. If nothing else, that would be a channel of revenue generated by people who are actually using the infrastructure that the bill is supposedly going to invest in.\n\nOf course, no discussion of hesitant Democrats would be complete without checking in on King Joseph over on the Senate side, right? As you might expect, the current proposal is a non-starter for him also.\n\nIn a radio interview with @HoppyKercheval, Sen. Manchin signals there are circumstances under which he won't vote to get onto the infrastructure bill. \"As the bill exists today, it needs to be changed,\" Manchin says. \u2014 Steven Portnoy (@stevenportnoy) April 5, 2021\n\nThe part that\u2019s not being said aloud by many of these Democrats is that they\u2019re very nervous about the idea of significantly hiking up the taxes paid by large corporations because those same corporations channel a lot of cash into political campaigns through various methods. Once you start biting the hand that feeds you, those contributions may begin drying up. There\u2019s also the possibility of voter backlash if employers begin scaling back on hiring and benefits to make up for the additional revenue they lose to Uncle Sam.\n\nThe razor-thin margins the Democrats have in both chambers appear to be creating a trap for Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, along with Joe Biden as well. They can try to ram through all of these massive, budget-busting plans via reconciliation with no support from any Republicans and very likely suffer a beating at the polls next year like the one they experienced in 2010. Or they can significantly temper their expectations to gain some GOP support, but risk a revolt from the Squad and their own far-left flank. I\u2019m sure that neither option is looking terribly appetizing at the moment."

          "text": "Is there real fire behind all of the smoke, or has Matt Gaetz fallen victim to a media smear campaign? As the tales have gotten more outlandish \u2014 not to mention recycled \u2014 the impulse is to lean toward the former. Perhaps, however, this eye-popping Twitter thread from Washington Post reporter Matt Zapotosky should have us demanding greater scrutiny to these claims, until extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims finally emerges.\n\nZapotosky spoke with Gaetz\u2019 former director of military affairs, who got questioned by the FBI about Gaetz. According to Captain Nathan Nelson, the agents informed him that \u201cnational media\u201d sources had told them Nelson had quit over Gaetz\u2019 alleged \u201cillegal activities.\u201d Not only was that untrue, Nelson had never even suggested any illegal activity on Gaetz\u2019 part:\n\nBut by Nelson's account, that was not true. He told me he had no knowledge of Gaetz being involved in illegal activities, & had left the office for other reasons. \u201cHe\u2019s always been very, very professional in his public life,\u201d Nelson said of Gaetz. \u2014 Matt Zapotosky (@mattzap) April 5, 2021\n\nNelson has no issue with the FBI for following up on tips, but he clearly resents the rumors involving his supposed knowledge and the circumstances of his departure. He told Zapotosky that he would hold a press conference to \u201cpre-empt\u201d those rumors from getting into the media narratives, and to also call into question much of the reporting on Gaetz thus far:\n\nNelson said he wanted to hold the press conference essentially to pre-empt what he viewed as a false report that he knew about illegal activities involving Gaetz. He told me, though, that no media had contacted him about such a report; he was hearing that 2ndhand from the FBI \u2014 Matt Zapotosky (@mattzap) April 5, 2021\n\nNelson\u2019s brief presser can be seen in this video, which apparently was filmed from someone\u2019s 2003 version of a Palm Pilot. Nelson told the media that any suggestion that he left on bad terms or had ever expressed any concerns about Gaetz\u2019 activities was entirely false. \u201cI\u2019m saying the allegations that named me were baseless,\u201d Nelson told reporters, \u201cthat kind of reflects on the allegations against Congressman Gaetz.\u201d\n\nLiterally the first question Nelson gets asked is for evidence to prove the negative, of course:\n\nIs this a definitive debunking of all the allegations against Gaetz? No, and that\u2019s not quite what Nelson claims either. What he does point out is that the media is conducting a feeding frenzy with very little if any solid evidence behind it \u2014 and they got it spectacularly wrong in his case. How much else have they gotten wrong?\n\nEven worse, however, is that the FBI apparently got sent in his direction from a \u201cnational media\u201d source. If that\u2019s true, that suggests that at least some of this frenzy is media generated, not media covered. It\u2019s also possible that the agents might have told Nelson that as a misdirection to protect a source. That doesn\u2019t make any sense at all if Nelson never said anything of the sort to anyone, though, as he told the press today.\n\nAs an elected official, Gaetz\u2019 conduct is fair game for media scrutiny. Before we stampede the man out of office, however, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re seeing media scrutiny rather than a rumor-fueled witch hunt. Skepticism should be the default, especially as the claims get wilder while the evidence keeps failing to materialize."

They call themselves Recall SF School Board. About three weeks ago, that group was shown a thread of tweets which Alison Collins had published back in 2016. The old tweets contained some inflammatory comments about Asian parents and students. For instance:\n\nIn fact many Asian American Ts, Ss, and Ps actively promote these myths. They use white supremacist thinking to assimilate and \"get ahead\". \u2014 Alison Collins \u9ad8\u52f5\u601d (@AliMCollins) December 4, 2016\n\nCollins issued a semi-apology but refused to resign or even to delete the tweets. Meanwhile, Mayor London Breed and nearly every member of the SF school district joined the push to oust Collins as did two members of the SF School Board. Eventually, even the LA Times editorial board called on Collins to resign. That culminated in a 5-2 vote by the school board to strip Collins of her title and her committee assignments. However, she is still a voting member of the board.\n\nLast week, in response to the vote, Collins filed an $87 million lawsuit against her colleagues on the board:\n\nA lawsuit filed by San Francisco school board member Alison Collins took everyone by surprise, including her own colleagues who are also being sued by her. Collins says her First Amendment Rights were violated after she received a vote of no confidence for posting derogatory remarks against Asian Americans. Collins has set a price, $87 million as punishment for allegedly having her first amendment rights violated.\n\nSo is this going anywhere? Mission Local wrote an amusing piece about the lawsuit Collins and her attorneys filed, calling it \u201can amazing document.\u201d\n\nReading through Collins\u2019 complaint, however, she may end up with nothing. This lawsuit is an amazing document, and not in a good way \u2014 and all the more so because three different law firms were involved in its crafting. That\u2019s on par with four writers being credited with the screenplay of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\u2026 \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a lawsuit,\u201d summed up UC Davis law professor Ash Bhagwat. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an op-ed pretending to be a lawsuit.\u201d \u2026 Similarly, Collins\u2019 claim of \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d from her colleagues struck scholars as bizarre in the context of elected office. \u201cThis is absurd,\u201d said Joel Paul, a UC Hastings professor. \u201cYou can\u2019t complain when people express opinions about you that are hostile. That is part of the job of a public official.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in reading the full document it\u2019s here. Even putting aside some of the colorful language in it, Collins appears to have no real case. Mission Local notes there is a previous case from 2010 in which Ken Blair, a member of a school board in Washington state, was similarly stripped of his role as Vice President and sued the school board on First Amendment grounds. Here\u2019s how that case turned out:\n\nBlair lost. At every level. The 9th Circuit panel ruled that Blair\u2019s First Amendment rights were not chilled, and his colleagues were entitled to strip him of his leadership position in favor of a \u201cvice president who better represented the board\u2019s majority view.\u201d The ruling finds that while \u201cthe First Amendment protects Blair\u2019s discordant speech as a general matter; it does not, however, immunize him from the political fallout of what he says.\u201d\n\nIn short, there is a nearly identical case decided a decade ago which went completely against the plaintiff. So the chance that judges are going to ignore that precedent and hand Alison Collins millions of dollars is somewhere near absolute zero. Her attorneys must know that but went ahead with this anyway. This has all the hallmarks of a made-for-media stunt. I\u2019m sure working with Collins is going to fun from here on out."

          "text": "Meh. Even when they\u2019re right to be angry, I disdain legislators threatening businesses for their politics. If McConnell wants to take away Major League Baseball\u2019s antitrust exemption or raise corporate taxes to make sure companies pay their \u201cfair share,\u201d why does he need some cultural grievance to spur him to do it? Do it because it\u2019s good economics.\n\nAnd if he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s good economics, why would he let a cultural grievance entice him into doing needless economic damage to some sector?\n\nIronically, I think the Republican politician who\u2019s best handled the aftermath of MLB pulling the All-Star Game out of Georgia is Trump. He didn\u2019t call for legislative action or make any policy threats; he called for a grassroots boycott of Major League Baseball by Republican voters. (He also insisted that the election was rigged, but what else is new?) That\u2019s the way to do this. Set economic policy at the federal level according to whatever will encourage growth and punish the woke behemoths by encouraging righties to organize and throw their weight around as consumers. They\u2019re woefully deficient about that relative to the left.\n\nStill, given the upset about MLB\u2019s boycott, McConnell had to show the base he\u2019s prepared to \u201cfight\u201d \u2014 especially after Trump\u2019s statement this weekend. He\u2019s strategically vague on what that would mean in practice here but the point is clear enough. He\u2019s standing up for Georgia:\n\n\u201cThis disinformation [about Georgia\u2019s law] has a purpose. Washington Democrats want to pass a sweeping bill that would let them rewrite all 50 states\u2019 election laws and turn the Federal Election Commission into a Democrat-run partisan body. This power grab is impossible to defend, so the left wants to deflect. Instead of winning the debate, they want to silence debate by bullying citizens and entire states into submission. \u201cIt\u2019s jaw-dropping to see powerful American institutions not just permit themselves to be bullied, but join in the bullying themselves. Wealthy corporations have no problem operating in New York, for example, which has fewer days of early voting than Georgia, requires excuses for absentee ballots, and restricts electioneering via refreshments. There is no consistent or factual standard being applied here. It\u2019s just a fake narrative gaining speed by its own momentum. \u201cOur private sector must stop taking cues from the Outrage-Industrial Complex. Americans do not need or want big business to amplify disinformation or react to every manufactured controversy with frantic left-wing signaling. \u201cFrom election law to environmentalism to radical social agendas to the Second Amendment, parts of the private sector keep dabbling in behaving like a woke parallel government. Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order. Businesses must not use economic blackmail to spread disinformation and push bad ideas that citizens reject at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the first Republican to point out that New York, the home of Major League Baseball, has more restrictive voting laws than Georgia does:\n\nPerhaps the @MLB should take a look at the restrictive voting laws in their home state of New York before criticizing ours. pic.twitter.com/Vd6IuzlMsq \u2014 Governor Brian P. Kemp (@GovKemp) April 3, 2021\n\nOther states now competing to host the All-Star Game also have \u201cproblematic\u201d voting laws. Colorado requires voter ID while Wisconsin forbids handing out food or drink to voters in line. The president\u2019s home state also has harsher voting laws than Georgia. There\u2019s no no-excuse early voting or absentee voting in Delaware, believe it or not. If Georgia is \u201cJim Crow on steroids,\u201d what does that make Biden\u2019s state? The Third Reich?\n\nMost of the public embarrassment will be reserved for MLB itself, though. This morning Marco Rubio sent a letter to the game\u2019s commission, Rob Manfred, asking if he\u2019ll forfeit his membership at Augusta to protest the new voting law. Fox also dinged the league this weekend by noting that their standards for Chinese outfits are less exacting than their standards for Georgia:\n\n[T]he MLB signed a deal with Tencent Wednesday, one of China\u2019s largest tech companies. It\u2019s one of the Chinese firms that briefly dropped NBA games in 2019 after former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey publicly voiced support for pro-democracy protesters facing a Beijing-backed crackdown in Hong Kong. The new deal grants Tencent rights to stream MLB games in a number of Asian countries until 2023. Back in 2018, the MLB and Tencent reached another deal that granted the company streaming rights for 125 games within China.\n\nThat\u2019s the way to do it. Skip the legislative threats; organize boycotts and focus on shaming them for their hypocrisy at every turn. Make political gestures such a headache for companies that they\u2019ll risk making them only when the balance of equities in a particular political dispute is clear and egregiously lopsided. Which it isn\u2019t in the case of Georgia\u2019s law, as even some fair-minded liberals have begun to acknowledge:\n\nBad stuff:\n\n\u2013 shorter window to request absentee ballot\n\n\u2013 later mailing of absentee ballots\n\n\u2013 limiting drop boxes (The stated concern is security, but this is already addressed by moving them inside voting sites)\n\n\u2013 shorter runoffs, which could limit the window for early voting /2 \u2014 Will Saletan (@saletan) April 3, 2021\n\nOverhyped:\n\n\u2013 Only poll workers can give water to voters in line, and nobody can do it within 150 feet of polling place. The idea is to limit influence. Excessive IMO, but there are loopholes: poll workers, 150 feet, and \"third-party groups [can] have food and water available.\" /4 \u2014 Will Saletan (@saletan) April 3, 2021\n\nDebatable:\n\n\u2013 Government can no longer send unsolicited absentee ballot applications. IMO, the stated concern, risk of fraud, is solved by voter ID.\n\n\u2013 Drop boxes now accessible only during early voting hours. I think this is just because they now have to be inside voting sites. /6 \u2014 Will Saletan (@saletan) April 3, 2021\n\nTo my amazement, a Democratic member of the House admitted yesterday that his own side is exaggerating the risks from Georgia\u2019s law:\n\nAfter studying the Georgia voting law, I believe it's not as good and necessary as Rs would like you to believe, nor as comprehensively horrible and unnecessary as Ds are arguing. In the spirit of objectivity, please read the law and have a look at @saletan's assessment, below: https://t.co/CIYfQu42BL \u2014 Rep. Dean Phillips \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RepDeanPhillips) April 4, 2021\n\nIt\u2019s not even clear that the new law will reduce turnout.\n\nCasual news consumers coming to this debate without having read the statute are conflating two things, I think. They distrust the Georgia GOP\u2019s motives in tinkering with election reform after the \u201cstop the steal\u201d campaign, and they should. How could they do otherwise after Trump pushed for months to try to overturn the results, replete with a call to Georgia\u2019s secretary of state asking him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to prove that he won? The fact that he and the GOP keyed in on swing-state cities with large black populations like Philly and Milwaukee as likely hotbeds of fraud made the effort smell even worse, as it was the suburbs where Biden improved most dramatically over Hillary. Democrats are fully justified in assuming bad intentions when they hear that a state that used to practice Jim Crow has suddenly changed how its citizens vote after three Democrats won statewide races with massive black support and the GOP baselessly howled about election-rigging the whole way.\n\nIt\u2019s just that the assumption doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny once you read the law, as Saletan did. We have an actual legislative product we can consult here instead of having to read Republicans\u2019 minds, and questionable motives didn\u2019t produce a sinister statute in the end. The most aggressive restrictions that were proposed, like ending no-excuse absentee balloting or eliminating Sunday voting to prevent black community leaders from organizing \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d initiatives, didn\u2019t make it into the final version. Democrats\u2019 justifiable fears turned out to be unfounded. But since they\u2019re heavily invested in passing H.R. 1 \u2014 partly because other Republican states are also overhauling their election laws to correct for the \u201ccheating\u201d that didn\u2019t actually happen last year \u2014 they\u2019re doubling down on their narrative that Georgia\u2019s law is the worst thing since slavery. And lefty activists have strong-armed corporations like MLB, Delta, and Coca-Cola into backing them up.\n\nHere\u2019s Chris Christie aptly condemning Joe Biden for resorting to the same behavior he condemned during the campaign, stooping to racial demagoguery to advance a policy priority."
